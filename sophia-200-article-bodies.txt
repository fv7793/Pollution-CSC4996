 A chemical spill at Ben Taub Hospital drew hazmat crews to the Texas Medical Center Sunday morning. One person was treated for chemical exposure after a leak detected around 9:20 a.m. sparked a small-scale evacuation. It was not clear whether a patient or worker was contaminated in the spill, but HFD spokeswoman Sheldra Brigham said it was not a firefighter. The leaked chemical was not immediately identified, and crews were still on scene as of 11 a.m.

 Crews have capped and sealed two pits of paper mill sludge that poisoned the San Jacinto River for decades, Harris County officials said Wednesday. But as County Attorney Preliminary soil samples indicate that the 3- to 5-acre pit, which is located beneath a shipyard on the other side of the Interstate 10 bridge from the larger Superfund site, contains dioxins and other toxic chemicals. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says it's too early know if they are linked. Still, the discovery means there may be more than one source of the San Jacinto's toxic stain, said "We're still looking for other sources," he said. Meanwhile, the primary concern remains the cleanup of the two submerged waste pits, which the EPA placed on its Superfund roster of the nation's most polluted places in 2008. In the first phase of the project, crews installed a polyethylene liner and poured 70,000 tons of rocks over it to prevent the further spread of the contamination. The cap is intended to withstand a 100-year storm event, said The $10 million phase is scheduled to be complete by the end of July, followed by years of regular monitoring. Under federal law, "The No. 1 goal is to stop the bleeding of dioxins into the river," said The next step may be the removal of the contaminated soil. But the EPA, state and county officials will study whether digging up the muck will create new problems for the river before moving ahead. If dredging isn't feasible, then the armor cap could be the permanent solution, Leos said. "But that's not the intent. It's not over after they place the cap." McGinnes, which is no longer in business, owned and operated the pits in the 1960s, filling a 15-acre site on dry land with waste from a now-closed paper mill near the Washburn Tunnel. In the bleaching process, paper mills generated large amounts of dioxins, a family of compounds so toxic that scientists measure them in trillionths of a gram. The EPA says there is no safe level of exposure to the chemicals, which are known to cause cancer and disrupt immune and reproductive systems. The San Jacinto began to run through the waste pits by the early 1970s because of subsidence — the sinking of soft soils as water is pumped from underground. With the McGinnes pits under water, the dioxins spread into the river and worked their way through the ecosystem. For more than a decade, the "The goal is that within a short period of time the river will be cleaned up and it will be safe to eat fish again from these waters," Ryan said. <em class="Taglines ,Signers,Etc.-Signer Italic HoustonText"><a href="mailto:matthew.tresaugue@chron.com">matthew.tresaugue@chron.com</a></em>

 Caption Close The Environmental Protection Agency late Thursday confirmed the fears of citizens and environmental activists that Hurricane Harvey flooding spawned a leak in one of the most dangerous and vulnerable of Houston's Superfund sites - the San Jacinto Waste Pits. The pits, along Interstate 10 between Channelview and Highlands in eastern Harris County, hold wastes deposited there for decades from a paper mill - including dioxin, one of the most powerful known human carcinogens. <strong>DAMAGE: <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-weather/hurricaneharvey/article/EPA-says-only-13-Superfund-sites-flooded-and-or-12169602.php" target="_blank">EPA says Harvey may have flooded 13 sites</a></strong> In a study of the site, Sam Brody, a Texas A & M professor had predicted that a powerful flood like that caused by Harvey could cause a rupture that would spill toxins into the San Jacinto River with the same power as a loaded gun. A resident of the badly flooded riverbottom near Channelview had taken a drone video that appeared to show damage. But the EPA and spokesmen for the company overseeing the clean-up had previously claimed that there appeared to be no rupture of an armored cap at the site. A sample from one of the fourteen areas tested at the Superfund site found dioxins at 70,000 ng/kg, the agency said on Thursday. The recommended clean up level from the EPA for the site is 30 ng/kg. The sample showed the protective cap had been damaged and underlying waste material was exposed. Neighborhoods around the dioxin pits received a wall of water after Harvey's floods - particularly hard-hit were the riverbottom neighborhoods immediately adjacent to the pits, where homes were knocked off their foundations, filled with silt and slammed into sink holes. <strong>AFTER HARVEY: <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/politics/article/ After-Harvey-EPA-administrator-vows-bold-12218929.php" target="_blank">EPA chief vows bold response</a></strong> EPA now has ordered both International Paper and Industrial Maintenance Corporation to conduct supplemental sampling to make sure the exposed waste material is isolated. The dioxin in the waste material does not dissolve easily but its possible that it could migrate out further  into the surrounding sediments, the agency said. The supplemental sampling will conclude the extent, if any,  of the migration. EPA could send out additional visual dive operations if they feel its necessary, to check for displacement in the stone cover of the protective cap and evaluate it for further damage caused by the storm. Harris County assistant county attorney Rock Owens, who has sued over past problems at the pits. Jackie Young, who grew up in the nearby Highlands and is founder of a grass-roots group of activists called Texas Health and Environment Alliance, expressed alarm that "unprecedented concentrations of highly toxic dioxin have been found uncontained in the river. " "Anyone who is under the impression that the temporary cap on the Pits remained intact through Harvey, is seriously misinformed," Young added. "The scary part about this is we have no way of knowing where all the contaminated material was carried by Harvey's floodwaters. Just imagine if we'd received storm surge; the community would've received a double dose of poison- waste carried north, then flushed south towards Galveston Bay. " The pits were used through the 1960s and 1970s and originally were located on river's west bank. But over time, the site has been repeatedly flooded. The pits were capped in 2011. Hot-spots of cancer-causing dioxin, a byproduct of paper-making, previously have been found in a series of studies of the sediments in the San Jacinto River and in the Galveston Bay downstream, according to research conducted by the University of Houston.

Welding crews lay pipelines east of Karnes City to get oil and gas extracted from the Eagle Ford shale formation to market. CARRIZO SPRINGS — Energy companies have disclosed some of the chemicals pumped into the ground to extract oil and gas at more than 1,700 locations across Texas in the first two months since the state began requiring the site-specific information. Yet the early returns have brought a collective shrug in the Eagle Ford play in South Texas, where almost every oil and gas well is hydraulically fractured - or fracked - with a brew of water, sand and chemicals. "The regulation is fine, but it's not going to do any good," said Oil and gas drilling has expanded rapidly in the past few years because of hydraulic fracturing. The increased activity has led to calls to disclose the cocktails used to break tightly packed rock containing oil and gas. The reports show that drillers employ dozens of chemicals, such as hydrochloric acid and methanol, to help free oil and gas deposits in the shale rock. Chemicals, however, are a small part of the overall mix, which is mostly water and sand. <em style="font-weight: bold;">Reports online</em> Texas is one of at least nine states to require energy companies to disclose most of their chemicals in an attempt to resolve concerns about the safety of drilling. The reports can be found on FracFocus, an industry-supported website operated by two groups representing regulators. Even before the Texas rule took effect Feb. 1, companies voluntarily posted their fracturing fluids at 4,200 Texas sites on the registry. As of Friday, Texas had 5,932 oil and gas wells listed at FracFocus, by far the most of any state. <em style="font-weight: bold;">No challenges</em> "This kind of activity is bound to help industry with public perception," said Critics say the Texas rules fall short because they allow energy firms to withhold trade secrets. The missing ingredients make it impossible to predict how the chemicals will react in the fracturing process, they say. The rules allow landowners to challenge proprietary claims for fracking fluids, but no one has, The disclosure push comes amid surging oil production in the Eagle Ford, one of the nation's hottest plays. The region, where the first well was drilled only four years ago, produced more than 30 million barrels in 2011, with forecasts for even more this year. Trotter has nine shale wells on his land, including three drilled in August by Chesapeake Energy Corp., the nation's second-largest natural-gas company. Chesapeake reported using recipes with up to 40 ingredients - although water and sand make up more than 98 percent of the fluid. The company pumped about 6 million gallons of water into The chemicals include hydrochloric acid to crack the rock, methanol to prevent pipe corrosion, and petroleum distillate hydro­treated light to reduce friction in the well. These chemicals can pose serious health threats, from liver damage to respiratory problems, but also are found in everyday products, such as household cleaners. <em style="font-weight : bold;">No worries, yet</em> Despite the greater disclosure, some scientists say it remains unclear whether the chemical makeup, which varies by company and well, should cause concern. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=news%2Fhouston -texas&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Jim+Byrd%22">Jim Byrd</a> "If they were using dangerous chemicals, it would be an issue," Byrd said. "But I don't know that they are." Just in case, "It doesn't cause me any worries," Riha said. "Down the line it might, but not yet." The Environmental Protection Agency is examining claims that hydraulic fracturing has contaminated water wells in North Texas and four other states. An interim report is due this year, with the final study to be released in 2014. A recent The risk, the scientists said, appears greater from surface spills of undiluted chemicals. The primary issue is poorly constructed wells that allow gas or fluids to leach into aquifers, the study said. No one, however, should suggest that hydraulic fracturing is risk-free, said Anderson, the EDF analyst. Regulators should more closely scrutinize drilling plans and operations to ensure the protection of aquifers, he said. <em style="font-weight : bold;">'Things happen'</em> Scientists and environmental groups should use the disclosure statements to gain a better understanding of how the chemicals are used, how often, and what the long-term health risks may be, said the "If it was just sand and water, people would not be concerned," Reed said. "It's in everyone's best interests to get away from the most toxic chemicals.

 Caption Close Texans who own private water wells in areas flooded by Hurricane Harvey now can have their water tested for contamination -- and they don't have to pay a penny. This free testing is available through Texas A&M University's AgriLife Extension Service with help from Virginia Tech and the Rural Community Assistance Program. To get their water tested, residents must pick up a test kit from their local AgriLife Extension office or other designated location. They need to return the sample to the office from 8 to 11 a.m. on the appropriate collection date. Virginia Tech then will examine the sample for coliform bacteria. Diane Boellstorff, an AgriLife Extension water resource specialist, said in a news release that all residents should assume their well water is contaminated. They should not use water from a flood well for cooking, bathing or drinking until it is tested for contaminants, she added. Boellstorff, who is in Texas A&M University's soil and crop sciences department, said floodwater could contain sewage from flooded wastewater treatment plants as well as manure, among other things. "Data from the well water testing will help us better understand a flood's impact on private wells and help us enhance our communications relating to well water quality," she said. Officials began handing out sample kits last week. The kits come with instructions and will be handed out on a first-come, first-served basis because supplies are limited.

Caption Close Thick black smoke resumed at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. facility Friday, Mar 22. Thick black smoke resumed at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. facility Friday, Mar 22. <strong>Update at 7:30 p.m.: </strong> During a briefing on Friday afternoon, Francisco Sanchez, Harris County's deputy emergency management coordinator, urged residents to stay informed over the weekend after another fire was contained at the ITC plant in Deer Park and clean-up operations would continue. "Our hope is this does not happen again, but should it happen we'll be ready to respond," said Sanchez. Sanchez said their main area of concern were the communities surrounding the plant and noted that Harris County remained at a low risk. The fires were contained at the ITC plant in Deer Park late Friday afternoon, according to company spokesman Dale Samuelson. "The fire has been extinguished," said Samuelson. Samuelson said it was unclear how many tanks caught fire or the chemicals that were inside, but he said they would release that information when it becomes available. At least two tanks were on fire at the plant, sending up another plume of black smoke, according to the Harris County Office of Emergency Management. <strong>Update at 4:47 p.m.:</strong> ITC confirmed in a news release that the tanks in the west side of the containment area have re-ignited. A runoff ditch along Tidal Road also appears to be ablaze. "This is a developing incident," ITC officials said in the statement. "We will provide additional information as soon as it becomes available." Harris County authorities said the fire is taking place within the original tank farm that was the site of the fire earlier this week. It's unclear where the blaze began or what caused it. ITC couldn't immediately confirm what chemicals are in the affected tanks. Deer Park's office of emergency management referred to the smoke as a "flare up." A shelter-in-place isn't in effect at this time. "The City of Deer Park is not issuing a Shelter-in-Place order at this time but we are monitoring the situation," the office said. The Sam Houston Tollway Ship Channel bridge was closed due to the fire but was  re-opened by Harris County Precinct Eight constables shortly before 5 p.m. <strong>Original story:</strong> A wall surrounding the damaged tank farm at the charred Deer Park chemical storage facility breached shortly after noon Friday, company and Harris County officials said, increasing the risk that airborne and liquid toxins will be released from the site. <strong>HOUSTONCHRONICLE.COM INVESTIGATES: </strong> "We have learned that a portion of the tank farm containment wall containing the product has partially collapsed. Industrial neighbors and the Texas Battleship and Monument State Park should consider taking shelter-in-place precautions," said Intercontinental Terminals Co. spokesman Dale Samuelson. "We are coordinating with federal, state and local officials to resolve the issue as soon as possible." County emergency operations spokesman Aaron Ewing said local officials are working under an ongoing air monitoring plan to assess the situation at the facility where holding tanks began exploding on Sunday and burned for days. Officials noted that such a breach could affect the effectiveness of the foam blanket that is coating the tank farm in the hopes of preventing flare-ups and the release of further toxins. <strong>HOUSTON CHRONICLE EXCLUSIVE: <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/investigations/article/ Dangerous-chemicals-roadblocks-to-information-7420931.php?utm_campaign=chron&amp;utm_source= article&amp;utm_medium = https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chron.com%2Fnews%2Fhouston-texas%2Fhouston%2Farticle%2FShelter-in-place-for-Deer-Park-plant-fire-13705401.php%3Futm_source%3Dmobile%26utm_medium%3Dbktext" target="_blank">Dangerous chemicals create hidden dangers in Houston</a></strong> It is unclear whether the central risk posed by Friday's breach is airborne or into the Houston Ship Channel or Tucker Bayou.

"TCEQ is working to fully assess and mitigate any wider impact," the agency's roughly 2 p.m. statement read. The wall breach came shortly after ITC officials said crews could spend up to 12 hours pumping pyrolysis gasoline out of one of tanks and that during that time, the risk of benzene exposure in the air will increase. "There's going to be a lot of agitation in the tank when we start the pumping," Brent Weber, ITC incident commander, said. "There is an elevated risk of benzene emission during this time." <strong> WHAT RESIDENTS ARE SAYING: <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Deer-Park-fire-investigations-begin-amid-anxiety-13707427.php" target="_blank">Anxiety washes over Deer Park community after fire</a></strong> Pyrolysis gasoline, also known as "pygas" is a benzene-rich liquid byproduct that can be blended with other chemicals for use as a gasoline additive. That chemical was the source of a benzene spike on Thursday morning, after it leaked out from foam covering one of the tanks. City leaders issued a shelter in place that lasted for several hours. ITC officials estimated on Thursday that 14,000 barrels of pygas remained in that tank. However, ITC officials said Friday that about 20,000 barrels remained. <strong> WHAT IS BENZENE? </strong> Crews attempted to pump pygas from the tank on Thursday, but the effort didn't work, Weber said, in part because of an unideal environment concerning the positioning of the pump. The pump was also losing prime, he said. Aside from the roughly 20,000 barrels of product in the one tank, about 40,000 more barrels are expected to be removed, Weber said. Not all tanks are compromised, but they contain pygas and naptha, which have some percentage of benzene. Elevated levels of the highly carcinogenic benzene were detected early Thursday in the area near the plant, prompting a shelter in place that continued throughout the morning. Around 4:38 a.m. Friday, one air monitor specifically testing for benzene and  located about 500 yards from the tank farm picked up an elevated reading, falling within the threshold of taking additional precautionary measures, according to the Harris County Emergency Management Office. The reading, recorded by county officials, was higher than Thursday's. It showed lower readings later in the morning. An ITC spokesman said that because the Friday reading was "localized," there was no need for a public notice or shelter-in-place order. No other nearby monitors picked up elevated benzene readings, according to a map on the county's emergency management website. "We've got no indication that there was any [elevated benzene] spread anywhere else," the spokesman said. Deer Park Mayor Jerry Mouton said he isn't sure whether more shelter-in-place orders will be called but pointed to the possibility of more benzene releases as an indicator. "There is potential," he said. Mouton said he didn't like to speak in hypotheticals. Twice, he referred to the presence of benzene in everyday life. "You're already being exposed to some level of benzene," Mouton said. So far, fire investigators have not been able to access the facility to investigate the cause of the fire, according to the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office. <em>Samantha Ketterer and Brooke A.

 Caption Close Blue Bell may never find out how listeria got into the ice cream at its Brenham plant, according to documents released Wednesday by the U.S. Brenham is the largest of Blue Bell's three plants and its sheer size may have hampered the hunt for contamination points. Inspectors swabbed 186 surfaces in the plant in March and didn't find any listeria species, let alone the one linked to illness. The company had better luck in Oklahoma, where preliminary evaluations of its Broken Arrow facility indicated that equipment and ingredient buckets in a storage room could have been contaminated by listeria particles escaping from a drain, and that a machine that fills ice cream containers might have harbored the bacteria. The findings were contained in a 35-page letter from Blue Bell to the FDA released under the Freedom of Information Act. A second letter covering the company's findings at its Alabama plant has not been released. However, other FDA records released Wednesday show the agency found listeria monocytogenes, the species that causes illness in the Alabama plant in April, despite the company's previous comments that the plant there had not been linked to the outbreak. Last week, results from a private laboratory showed ice cream eaten by a man who fell ill in Florida tested positive for listeria. It came from the Alabama plant. Because listeria is widespread in the environment, it is sometimes impossible for investigators to pinpoint the source of an outbreak. The focus then turns to corrective measures, and Blue Bell says it is introducing a comprehensive set of cleaning, testing and training policies that go far beyond FDA requirements. Brenham is the largest of the plants, so upgrades will take longer, and it will be last to resume production, according to the letter. There is no timetable for when production will resume, and the plants aren't even producing test batches yet, spokeswoman "As we are still determining when production will resume," Van Dorf said.

 Caption Close The Environmental Protection Agency has approved a plan to stabilize the riverbed near the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund site to address the hazards of a 20,000-square-foot area where Hurricane Harvey gouged a pit about 12 feet deep. At the same time, the EPA and companies responsible for the cleanup say further inspection and tests indicate that a temporary concrete cap appeared to have held during the storm and therefore a major leak of cancer-causing dioxins was averted at the site of Interstate 10 near Channelview. The San Jacinto Waste Pits is one of 43 Superfund sites in the coastal areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. It's the only site that required additional followup and repairs, the EPA says. The pits - which hold waste from a former paper mill - were submerged when a wall of water as high as 18 inches above normal levels flooded the river area. On Sept. 29, the EPA ordered further testing at the Superfund site after a government dive team collected one sediment sample at the pits that tested at 70,000 micrograms per kilogram - 2,000 times higher than the EPA recommended cleanup level of 30 micrograms per kilogram. But the preliminary results of six additional sediment samples collected from the northwest corner of the site show far lower concentrations of the dioxins, ranging from only 0.02 micrograms per kilogram to 38.9 micrograms per kilogram, according to information provided Thursday to the Chronicle by companies handling the cleanup. <em style="font-weight: bold;">Optimistic report</em> Though one of those newly reported results exceeds the EPA recommended cleanup level, they are similar to levels previously found in river sediments there, the companies say. An independent Houston-based lab tested the samples, documents show. "No release of dioxins or furans has occurred from the San Jacinto waste pits site as a result of Hurricane Harvey," the companies claim, based on the new sampling. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who was visiting Houston om Thursday to meet with industry groups, recently announced that his agency is backing a plan to remove the waste pits entirely from the path of the river, partly because of damage caused by Hurricane Harvey. Various Harris County officials, environmental groups, citizen activists and members of Congress all back the proposed $115 million removal plan. The San Jacinto Waste pits were used into the 1960s to store waste that was taken by barge to the site from a paper mill. The site was originally on the riverbank in eastern Harris County, but over time, subsidence, dredging and construction of the Interstate Highway 10 bridge altered the path of the river and the site became partially submerged. The pits became a federal Superfund site in 2008 and were capped in 2011 partly in response to fears of damage from hurricanes. <em style="font-weight: bold;">Companies see risks</em> But the companies responsible for the clean-up - McGinnis Industrial Maintenance Corp., Waste Management and International Paper Co. , have said they will oppose a removal plan as too risky for the environment. The companies are likely to use their latest sediment samples to bolster an argument that reinforcing the existing cap is the best way to protect the river, its residents and the Galveston Bay itself. "In the new sampling results, dioxins and furans were found to be well within the range of concentrations of these toxins measured in sediment in the area prior to Hurricane Harvey and found in background levels generally in the San Jacinto River," the statement says. However, additional samples of water and sediments are still being tested and preliminary results of the water samples appear to confirm that there was a leak, said Rock Owens, an assistant Harris County attorney, who was briefed on some of the ongoing work Thursday. Scott Jones, director of advocacy of the Galveston Bay Foundation, argued that the tests were conducted weeks after the storm and that the companies still lack data needed to assure the public whether dioxin escaped or contaminated sediments migrated at the height of the flooding. He and others also remain concerned about the vulnerability of the cap to future storms. Jones said he fears the storm likely disturbed "hot spots" of dioxins that already had traveled from the pits into other parts of the ecosystem and been mapped by local researchers from the University of Houston. "You can try to sample after the fact, but you can't collect what has been released at the time," he said.

 Caption Close Residents near one of the region's most dangerous toxic dumps are increasingly concerned that the raging San Jacinto River, swollen to record heights by Tropical Storm Harvey, could be degrading concrete caps covering the site, allowing cancer causing dioxins to escape into the water. The San Jacinto Waste Pits, where waste from a nearby paper mill was buried, were at one time located on the banks of the river, but as the waterway changed course, they became submerged and have been the subject of concern and lawsuits for years. Now, based on observations of the damage the flooded river is doing to concrete bunkers at the Interstate 10 bridge near Channelview, concern is growing about what might be happening to the caps covering the Superfund site itself. Harris County officials, who successfully sued the current corporate owners of the pits over leaks in the cap, have demanded that the Environmental Protection Agency review the damage and leaks as soon as the heavily flooded area can be safely accessed by divers or robots. The county attorney's office also requested this week that the EPA release surveillance video of the pits. But so far the EPA has not responded, according to information the Houston Chronicle obtained through a public records request. "They potentially have a mess on their hands," said Assistant County Attorney Rock Owens. "Unfortunately, we will be waiting until the water recedes." Worried that flooding from Harvey may damage concrete waste Worried that flooding from Harvey may damage concrete waste On Saturday, the EPA released a statement  promising to inspect the site as soon as Monday if river conditions permit. The statement came  hours after both the Houston Chronicle and the Associated Press reported on concerns raised by the county on behalf of citizens who live near the pits. < a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-weather/hurricaneharvey/article/EPA-says-only-13-Superfund-sites-flooded-and-or-12169602.php"><em><strong>BREAKING: EPA says 13 Superfund sites flooded and/or potentially damaged by Hurricane Harvey</strong></em></a> In the statement, the EPA said it had already conducted initial assessments of all 41 Superfund sites in the areas impacted by Hurricane Harvey "using aerial images, as well as direct contact with the parties responsible for the ongoing clean-up." Thirteen of hazardous waste sites have been flooded - including the San Jacinto Waste Pits -  "and/or are experiencing possible damage due to the storm - though only two have been inspected and determined that they do not require "emergency cleanup," the statement says. The EPA said it will send teams to inspect the remaining 11 Superfund sites as soon as conditions allow. The San Jacinto Waste Pits contain cancer-causing dioxins and other industrial waste stored there in the 1960s and were officially designated for the Superfund clean-up program in 2008. The current owners of the site paid to cap the waste pits — but the caps have leaked and been repaired and replaced several times and experts have long predicted they could be destroyed by a major hurricane. "We are so concerned about that cap," said Gina Fields, a long-time resident who lives in a flooded area just a few miles upstream from the pits in Crosby. "If that water moved concrete barrier and bulldozers like it did — and houses too — we fear that cap is no longer there. And we're very concerned." Staff from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a state agency that is coordinating with the EPA on storm response statewide, attempted to secure waste containers and drums at many dump sites before Harvey hit. But the TCEQ has suspended many pollution reporting requirements under the emergency declared by Gov. Greg Abbott, and the TCEQ office in Houston remains closed. In the statement released Saturday, the EPA said it planned to move as quickly as possible  to inspect the "temporary armored cap" that is designed to prevent hazardous material from migrating downstream" at the waste pits site. "Based on forecasted river conditions this inspection is planned for Monday, by boat. EPA has dive teams to survey the cap underwater when conditions allow." "Despite misleading and inaccurate reporting, the facts are that EPA and TCEQ are working together, along with other local, state, and federal authorities and emergency responders around the clock to address the human health and environmental impacts of Hurricane Harvey and its effects, especially historic and devastating flooding throughout Southeast Texas," the statement said.. The EPA and TCEQ are working together to address widespread pollution problems after Hurricane Harvey that could pose potential risks for drinking water and public health at many sites statewide, according to statements released by both agencies. Dozens of residents from the waterfront neighborhood just west of the pits already were forced to wade through flooded yards to reach rescue boats on the river's Channelview side, according to Jackie Young, an activist who grew up in the San Jacinto River community of Highlands. Young alerted county officials to the signs of damage to the bridge. Young, who runs a grassroots group called Texas Health and Environment Alliance, was out of state when Hurricane Harvey closed airports and kept her in California. But she said she's personally heard from 30 evacuees forced to wade out to boats to evacuate neighborhoods nearest to the pits and emailed photos to county officials. All across the Houston areas, residents and rescuers alike have been walking and driving through floodwaters contaminated by industrial runoff and by overloaded municipal treatment plants. Municipal water supplies so far are considered safe. But hundreds of homes in Channelview, Highlands and Baytown near the pits rely on vulnerable individual wells for their drinking water. "The homes in the river bottom have come off their slabs and it's a very bad situation there – as in many areas across the region," Young said. "But the residents knowing that the waste pits are there, sitting across from the area, they're worried. I feel there's a shortcoming in the response in figuring out if the environment is safe. We need them to move quickly on a sampling plan." More than 600 people claim that their health, their property and their livelihoods already have been damaged from contact with river water tainted by dioxin, a potent carcinogen that is also linked to birth defects, according to allegations in a civil lawsuit that remains pending in Harris County. Bob Allen, director of Harris County's pollution control services department, reopened his office in Pasadena on Monday with a skeleton crew of five and has been busy calling hundreds of area treatment plants and industrial users to track potential dangers and leaks across Harris County. Not many operators at those sites have been answering their phones, he said. But Allen told the Chronicle Friday that his staff would use computerized mapping to determine how many of the 150 people whose wells already have been tested for potential dioxin contamination were likely flooded during Harvey. Young, the activist, said she hopes that water testing will be done as soon as possible so that residents can make informed decisions about the risk of returning to their homes or drinking from their wells. Ultimately, she wants to see the waste removed from the river entirely. This year, the Environmental Protection Agency has been reviewing an action plan supported by Harris County leaders, Young and other activists that would finally remove poisons from the submerged river pits forever. Action on that plan is expected before the end of the year, though an EPA spokeswoman told the Chronicle that there is no firm timeline. On Friday, Gina Fields, of the riverfront neighborhood Crosby, was helping rescue people and pets from flooded homes. "There should be no more debate," Fields said. "They need to remove those wastes from that river." Late Saturday, a spokesman for MMC, one of two companies involved in the cleanup of the San Jacinto Superfund site, said that both the cap and berms around it appear to remain in place, based on a visual inspection conducted by contractors Friday afternoon. Stone material around the berms, however, has washed away. The company said further updates will be posted on

 Caption Close A dive team earlier this month  found a large hole in the structure meant to contain toxic waste at the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site, according to an Environmental Protection Agency spokesman. The hole was discovered Dec. 10 or Dec. 11, according to David Gray, director of external affairs for  EPA Region 6 covering Texas. The EPA directed the companies responsible for the waste to submit a repair plan for the protective cap that would include confirmation sampling to make sure no toxic materials were emitted through the hole in the structure, according to an EPA statement. The waste comes from a Pasadena paper mill that 50 years ago deposited its waste along the San Jacinto River. The waste, from compounds once used to whiten paper, is highly toxic; the EPA says there is no safe level of exposure to the chemicals, which are known to cause cancer and disrupt reproductive and immune systems. A civil lawsuit from the state and Harris County that began last year asked the companies involved, International Paper Co., McGinnes Industrial Maintenance Corp. and Waste Management Inc., to be fined $25,000 a day dating back to the site's 1965 opening. The suit ended with two of the county's three targets agreeing to pay nearly $30 million in damages before a split jury cleared the remaining defendant of any responsibility for the toxic pollution. The companies installed the $9 million armored cap on the submerged pits to contain the sludge in 2011. The cap has needed minor repairs since then, mainly due to erosion, but nothing close to this level, said Jackie Young, a leader of the San Jacinto River Coalition, which seeks a solution to the waste. " This is what we feared," said Young. She said the hole measures 20 feet long and 10 feet deep and is on the northwest portion of the site.

 Caption Close ENSENADA, Chile (AP) — Twin blasts from the Calbuco volcano in southern Chile sent vast clouds of ash into the sky, covering this small town with thick soot and raising concerns Thursday that the dust could contaminate water, cause respiratory illnesses and ground more flights. Ensenada, in the foothills of the volcano, looked like a ghost town but for an occasional horse or dog roaming its only street. Most of the 1,500 residents had evacuated after the initial eruption Wednesday, with only about 30 people refusing to leave out of worry for their homes and animals. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news%2Flocal&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex = solr&amp;query=%22Daniel+Patricio+Gonzalez%22">Daniel Patricio Gonzalez</a> "This hurts a bit, but there's nothing to do against nature. The important thing is that my family is fine," Gonzalez said. The volcano erupted Wednesday afternoon for the first time in more than four decades, spewing out a plume of ash more than 6 miles (10 kilometers) high. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Calbuco had another spectacular outburst early Thursday with lightning crackling through a dark sky turned reddish orange by the explosion. As the ash cloud spread Wednesday, "people went into a state of panic," said Winds blew ash in a widening arc across to Argentina. No injuries were reported and the only person reported missing since the eruption was located Thursday. Authorities evacuated 4,000 people as gas and ash continued to spew, and they closed access to the area around the volcano, which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt, some 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) south of Santiago. "I was shocked. I had just arrived home when I looked through the window and saw the column of smoke rising up. We called our families, posted photos," said "We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us," Palma said, adding that many were concerned about the possible effects of the ash on their health. The Chilean national geology and mining service warned that people should prepare for a third and "even more aggressive eruption." President "We don't have any problems with supplies, water or sewage up to now. That's not the problem," she said. "Our problem is a respiratory one, from inhaling all of this ash, and the fact that this ash could generate some sort of environmental contamination." The short-term dangers related to the ash include eye and skin infections as well as water contamination, said "That's why the people in the area need to evacuate," Martorell said. The ash continued to fall Thursday in Puerto Montt and other nearby cities. LATAM and other airline companies cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. The 6,500 foot (2,000-meter) Calbuco last erupted in 1972 and is considered one of the top three most potentially dangerous among Chile's 90 active volcanos. By Thursday afternoon, ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of Calbuco. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business.

 Caption Close AUSTIN — Gov. Greg Abbott said state and federal authorities are still checking all the hazardous waste sites affected by flooding from Harvey. But Abbott said he has assurances from federal officials that none of the 11 affected Superfund sites still to be checked by the Environmental Protection Agency “pose any damage or danger to the public that is known at this time.” Concerns mounted over the weekend that flooding may have damaged some of the sites and carried away potentially toxic or dangerous chemicals. Abbott addressed the issue at a media  briefing Tuesday, saying the state has inspected five of the 17 state Superfund sites in the Houston area and “no major issues have been noted.” One — International Creosoting, a former wood-treatment plant, and later a ready-mix concrete operation — remains flooded, Abbott said. “We can’t say there is any danger or damage, however we can’t make any determination at this time,” he said at the news  conference in the state operations center in Austin. Thirty-three federal Superfund sites are in the affected area, 11 of which need “follow-up action by the EPA to confirm their status,” said Abbott, who has been in contact with a regional EPA administrator, but not the agency’s director, Scott Pruitt.  The federal agency is working with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to monitor the sites and contain any damage, Abbott said. The state is relying on the federal government for help in several areas, including controlling mosquitoes to try to stop potential spread of diseases carried by the insects. Costs for spraying within the first 30 days will be covered by the federal government and the Department of Defense will help with “wide-area spray,” according to Abbott. Local spraying already has begun, and the state is expected to pitch in this week. “If we can do an aggressive job containing this in the first 30 days after the storm, we will be able to get it under control,” Abbott said. Congress is expected to vote today on a $7.9 billion aid package for Harvey relief. “I feel confident that Texas is going to get the resources it needs,” Abbott said. The total storm-related cost is not yet clear, but recovery efforts are underway. All Texas interstates are now open, but 118 roads are still closed. Hospitals affected by the storm are beginning to come back online, with 95 percent of the hospitals in the greater Houston area reported to be functional. amorris@express-news.net

 SIKACHI-ALYAN, RUSSIA - Yevgenia Osadchaya is beside herself with worry, wondering how her family will survive when the toxic slick flowing from China pollutes the Amur River that provides the livelihood for her family and her native Nanai people. "Not eat fish for a whole year?" cried the 47-year-old, legally blind with cataracts. "How will our nation, the Nanai, live? We'll all die." The native peoples of Russia's Far East, many of whom rely on the Amur for food and income, are among those most endangered by the imminent arrival of 100 tons of benzene released into a tributary upriver after a deadly Chinese chemical plant explosion Nov. 13. The spill prompted Chinese authorities to shut down the water supply for Harbin, a northeast city of 3.8 million people, for five days. A second city — Jiamusi, which has about 500,000 people — also shut down a water plant on the Songhua River, fearing contamination, officials said Saturday. Russian authorities expect the slick to cross the border Dec. 10 or 11, and three days later reach the regional capital Khabarovsk. Restrictions on eating Amur fish could last a year or even several, as chemicals linger in the winter ice and riverbed, experts say. She said authorities would strive to inform villagers that eating the affected fish is even worse than drinking the water. Nearly 11,000 Nanai people live in the Khabarovsk region, comprising the largest native group here, according to the 2002 Russian census. Other minorities include the Evenki with 4,500 people, Ulchi at 2,700 and Nivchi at 2,500. Many of the Nanai, who retain their own language, are fishermen whose eastern Siberian ancestors once made clothes from scaly fish skins and who still make shoes from fish. Samples of the skins are shown at the village museum in Sikachi-Alyan, 37 miles downriver from Khabarovsk. Svetlana Oninka, a history teacher who runs the village's one-room museum, noted the importance that fish plays in traditional Nanai dishes, sometimes consumed raw. "Now there won't be fish — not boiled, fried and definitely not raw," she said. "It's hard to have a traditional life when you have legislation," she said, naming fishing and hunting quotas. The Nanai are already also coping with years of industrial pollution by chemicals such as phenol, which affects Amur fish in the winter, giving it a chemical smell. At least this village of 314 Nanai residents has another way besides fish to support itself. Stone carvings dating from 14,000 years ago are a steady draw for thousands of visitors a year. Residents make small fur-lined talismans with traditional symbols for health and long life, or small figures in native dress, to sell to tourists for $1.75 each. Still, Osadchaya worried that even that small trade could be devastated by the chemical spill. To supplement a pension she says is not enough to support her family, her daughter makes the souvenirs, and her sons go fishing. "If the spill arrives, then no one will come here," she said.

 NASHVILLE, TENN. — A burst dike at a coal-fired power plant in eastern Tennessee spilled millions more cubic yards of ash than originally estimated, officials said Friday, and residents fear the muck coating their neighborhood is endangering the drinking water. The state, however, said Friday that tests show water entering the treatment plant is safe. About 5.4 million cubic yards of coal fly ash, a byproduct of burning coal, broke out of a retention pond at the Kingston Fossil Plant, The TVA, the nation's largest utility company supplying electricity to 8.8 million people, first estimated Monday's breach had spilled less than half that amount.

"That's scary, to know that they can be off by that much," said Environmental activist groups said this week they worry about the danger to drinking water. Dead fish were seen floating downstream, but the TVA said that could have been caused by freezing temperatures that may have contributed to the dike bursting. The results of water sampling downstream from the plant indicated the concentrations of toxic contaminants were less than what state standards deem harmful to fish and aquatic life, TVA said in a news release Thursday. Friday evening, the state Environmentalists and the coal industry have argued for years over whether coal ash should be regulated as hazardous waste, which would make it subject to more regulations. In 2000, the EPA backed away from labeling it a hazardous waste but encouraged states to strengthen their regulations. <em > The <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fnation-world&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22New+York+Times%22">New York Times</a> contributed to this report.</em>

She cannot fish, or wash, or invite her relatives to stay. "The Chinese have poisoned my life," she said with a sigh.

As prosecutors look on, they seal the samples and send them to Khabarovsk for analysis. "I have nothing comforting to say," said Khabarovsk regional Gov.

"We are not yet registering a critical level of nitrobenzene in the water, but come spring this region will have a lot of unpleasantness in store," he said. The melting ice will pollute not just the water, but also river banks, he said.

 ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality wants $700,000 to better monitor, track and understand a dioxane plume that slowly has been expanding in Ann Arbor. The agency has asked state lawmakers to approve the allocation of Clean Michigan Initiative funds in fiscal year 2017, which starts in October, The Ann Arbor News reported ( Bob Wagner, the DEQ's Remediation and Redevelopment Division chief, said the agency would be able to use the money for environmental testing, monitoring groundwater, installing new monitoring wells and performing contaminant tracking. It also could be used for providing alternate water to residents and businesses whose water sources might become contaminated. Local officials and residents have been calling on the DEQ to do more to help address the plume from the former Gelman Sciences site. "We will provide safe drinking water to any resident or business that has well water ... exceeding the current criteria of 85 parts per billion, as well as the new proposed criteria that we'll soon be releasing," Wagner said. New state cleanup standards will lower the permissible level of dioxane in groundwater to somewhere under 10 ppb, he said. Currently, agency officials are limited by state law and court orders on what they can do from an enforcement standpoint. The department can't force Pall Corp., which dumped large amounts of the chemical into the environment from 1966 to 1986, to do a full-scale cleanup, and the pollution is still spreading despite ongoing pump-and-treat remediation efforts to reduce the amount of dioxane in the groundwater. Local officials want to ensure the plume doesn't reach the Huron River, which runs through Ann Arbor, and Barton Pond, where the city gets most of its drinking water. "My hope is still that the state and the city and Pall can work together to get the additional monitoring wells we think need to be installed," said Matt Naud, the city of Ann Arbor's environmental coordinator.

 Caption Close Texas is trying to take the federal government to task for failing to find a permanent disposal site for thousands of metric tons of radioactive waste piling up at nuclear reactor sites across the country. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday night, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton accuses U.S. agencies of violating federal law by failing to license a nuclear waste repository in Nevada — a plan delayed for decades amid a highly politicized fight. Paxton’s petition asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to force the Nuclear Regulatory Committee to cast an up-or-down vote on the Yucca Mountain plan. It also seeks to prevent the federal Department of Energy from spending billions of dollars in fees collected from utilities to fund a permanent nuclear waste disposal site. “For decades, the federal government has ignored our growing problem of nuclear waste,” Paxton said in a statement Wednesday. “The NRC’s inaction on licensing Yucca Mountain subjects the public and the environment to potential dangerous risks from radioactive waste. We do not intend to sit quietly anymore.” Paxton filed the lawsuit just two weeks after former Texas Gov. Rick Perry was sworn in as the agency’s leader. And it comes as Texas’ only radioactive waste site — run by Waste Control Specialists in Andrews County — is asking the NRC to let it temporarily store the nation’s spent nuclear fuel. About 78,000 metric tons of spent uranium rods are stored at operating or closed reactor sites throughout the country, with 2,610 metric tons in Texas. Those sites, mostly meant to be temporary, are filling up. Though the nuclear energy industry insists that temporary waste disposal — either in pools or sealed in dry casks of metal or concrete — is safe and environmentally sound, it has long agreed that sealing the waste in geologic formations deep underground boosts protection against terrorist attacks and natural disasters, such as the earthquake and tsunami that rocked Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in 2011. For more than 20 years, Washington saw  Yucca Mountain as the solution, and the federal government spent tens of millions of dollars preparing it to accept the waste. But Nevada’s congressional delegation — led by now-retired U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, a Democrat — has thwarted the project. And, facing significant political pressure, President Barack Obama’s administration abandoned the Yucca Mountain plans. Since 1983, utility ratepayers across the country chipped in billions of dollars to fund a waste repository — including $815 million collected from Texans. With interest, Texans have contributed $1.5 billion to the fund, managed by the Department of Energy. A 2013 federal appeals court ruling halted the collections, and the fund now has an unspent balance of $40 billion, according to Paxton’s lawsuit, which opens with a comment from Perry during his confirmation hearing as energy secretary: “My hope of this committee and administration is that we, finally after 35 years of kicking the can for whatever reason, we can start ... moving to temporary or permanent siting of this nuclear waste.” A Perry spokesman did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. During Perry’s tenure as governor, Texas became home to one of the nation’s few facilities that accept low-level nuclear waste. Since 2012, Waste Control Specialists, a company formerly owned by the late Dallas billionaire and Republican donor Harold Simmons, has disposed of contaminated tools, building materials and protective clothing, among other items, from shuttered reactors and hospitals. That site in Andrews County grew rapidly during Perry’s final years in office. Over the objection of environmental groups, the company is seeking a license to temporarily store spent reactor fuel — high-level nuclear waste. If Paxton’s suit does not force President Donald Trump’s administration to restart the Yucca Mountain plans, some observers say the federal government might more closely eye the Andrews County site — a move that would require Congress to change that 1987 law naming Yucca Mountain as the nation’s repository. Asked whether Paxton’s lawsuit had anything to do with Waste Control Specialists’ expansion plans, Kayleigh Lovvorn, his spokeswoman, said her office had no comment. Chuck McDonald, a spokesman for Waste Control Specialists, said the company had not yet read the lawsuit, “therefore, we don’t know if it will have an impact on our project or not.” But he added: “WCS has always been supportive of a permanent repository, and we believe a consolidated interim storage facility is needed as part of an integrated waste management system in the U.S.” Karen Hadden, executive director of the Sustainable Energy and Economic Development Coalition, a group fighting the Andrews County site’s expansion, agreed with Paxton’s criticism of the Yucca Mountain process — “a waste of money,” she said. But Hadden worries that the lawsuit could force the government to permit a site ill-equipped to protect public health and safety. “It’s really important that we get a permanent repository in place that will isolate this waste so we don’t have cancer effects or deaths from contamination today or into the future,” Hadden said. “My concern is that [Paxton] has another Texas permanent disposal site in mind.” --- < a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2017/03/15/texas-sues-feds-rick-perrys-agency-included-over-nuclear-waste/">texastribune.com</a>

 Caption Close TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Nearly halfway into a 10-year pledge  to combat the toxic algae that turns Lake Erie a ghastly shade of green, Ohio has made little progress. Its patchwork of mostly voluntary efforts hasn't slowed the farm fertilizers that feed algae blooms, leading to contaminated drinking water and dead fish. Ohio's governor has authorized an ambitious plan that this year will begin offering farmers financial incentives to adopt new agriculture practices and will create a network of wetlands to capture and filter runoff from fields. The broad approach is being watched closely by states struggling with an increasing number of algae outbreaks. Some environmental groups are skeptical, but others that have been at odds with the farming industry are hopeful. While there are no guarantees the strategy will revive the shallowest of the Great Lakes, there are potential pitfalls, including a lawsuit calling for tougher regulations, that could upend the state's goal of drastically reducing nutrient pollution entering the lake's western end by 2025. “We can’t move forward as a state unless we preserve Lake Erie,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said when he announced plans to pay farmers to voluntarily participate, part of $172 million targeted for water quality. One of the biggest hurdles is that the state must convince farmers to make changes without any certainty they will be enough. And no matter how many get on board, progress will be slow because phosphorus from chemical fertilizer and manure has built up for years. Backers of the state's plan worry that farmers could get discouraged and lawmakers may back away from committing more money if algae blooms continue to overwhelm the lake. That's why the state's immediate focus is on convincing farmers in the western Lake Erie region to commit to some changes. "Our measure of success will be in how many farmers enroll in each county," said Dorothy Pelanda, Ohio's agriculture director. They'll begin finding out in February how the state intends to distribute $30 million worth of incentives and what the money will cover. That's a big concern for those who've been hurt by depressed commodity prices, the trade war with China and one of the rainiest years in memory. Nathan Eckel, who raises cattle and farms with his family just outside Toledo, said he and many neighbors already are doing several recommended practices, including planting cover crops and vegetation along streams and mixing manure into the ground. "We're doing what's most time efficient and what's best financially," he said. One of the state's suggestions for reducing phosphorus runoff is to inject fertilizer into fields instead of on top, but that equipment costs close to $200,000. " How do you justify that coming off a year like we just had?" Eckel said. What holds back others are lingering questions about whether the recommended steps are feasible and effective, said Robyn Wilson, a behavioral researcher at Ohio State University. "I can't  blame the farmer," she said. "Even those committed to it aren’t getting enough feedback." Surveys have shown that while up to 20% might not be willing to change, a larger share are open to new ways but face barriers, many of them financial. "It’s a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time," she said. Ohio's governor has said offering incentives is the key. "We cannot expect farmers to do things that will drive them out of business," said DeWine, who first talked about long-term solutions just months after he took office a year ago. States throughout the U.S. will be monitoring Ohio's results because reducing nutrient pollution from farms has been a much bigger challenge than slowing it from sewage plants and factories, said Dan Obenour, an environmental engineer at North Carolina State University. “In general, states are still trying to figure it out,” Obenour said. Ohio's leaders have been under pressure to fix the lake since algae toxins in 2014 left more than 400,000 people around Toledo unable to drink their tap water. Studies by have shown that roughly 85% of the phosphorus going into the lake comes from agriculture. Many experts think the only way to reduce that is to order agriculture to make changes  instead of relying on volunteers. A federal lawsuit that could be ruled on this year is seeking to force Ohio to adopt enforceable regulatory standards. The state's agriculture director said they'll continue to move ahead with their plan, not knowing what will come from the courts. There's a sense of urgency because Ohio's leaders say they're committed to sticking with the previous administration's promise to cut 40% of the phosphorus flowing into western Lake Erie within the next five years. If they fall short, the only choice may be tougher regulations that farmers have been trying to avoid.

 BUTTE, Mont. (AP) — It was an unusual and unfortunate confluence of events: A larger-than-normal number of geese was making a later-than-normal migration over Montana when a snowstorm blew in at the wrong time and sent them soaring to the wrong place. The throngs of white birds splashed down in a 50 billion-gallon toxic stew in a former copper mine that is part of the nation's largest Superfund site. At least 3,000 died. Residents of this mining city say the snow goose deaths this fall were a wake-up call that raises broader questions about the site. They worry federal regulators won't ready to prevent the heavily acidic, metal-laden water from contaminating other waterways and Butte's groundwater as the pit nears capacity. "We need to be pr The The liquid is expected to reach a critical level in 2023, and environmental officials are finalizing a plan for keeping it from polluting Butte's groundwater and Silver Bow Creek, a stream at the headwaters of the Columbia River basin. The critical level is 5,410 feet, set by the The The Horseshoe Bend plant now treats more than 4 million gallons of water a day that would otherwise flow into the pit, and the plan is for it to treat another 3 million gallons a day directly from the pit starting in 2023. The plant has never handled 7 million gallons at once, but EPA officials say there is enough time for a thorough review to ensure the contaminated water will never escape into the city's Silver Bow Creek, whose banks have yet to be cleaned of the mine waste that was dumped there for decades. "We're going to really start digging into pilot studies and performance testing ... to determine what kind of upgrades, what kind of redundancies do we need," EPA project manager Atlantic Richfield and Montana Resources, which operates Horseshoe Bend, are confident the treatment plant will work as designed. Atlantic Richfield spokesman <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel= news%2Fus-world&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Mark+Thompson%22">Mark Thompson</a> The recent mass goose deaths were an anomaly, he said, and activists' attempt to tie them to a threat to Butte is "well overblown." But community activists worry the treatment-plant option is being favored because it's the cheapest technology, not the best. They also suspect Atlantic Richfield will seek a waiver from the EPA allowing it to discharge pit water into Silver Bow Creek that doesn't meet Montana's clean water standards. If that happens, the creek will be devastated, and the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on cleaning waterways downstream will be erased, according to community coalition Restore Our Creek. "When you think about the Berkeley pit water, whatever form that takes, it's going to have to go through this one mile," member Greene acknowledged the EPA is studying a possible waiver of the state's water quality standards, but said he could not elaborate because it is part of confidential negotiations with Atlantic Richfield. "I'm very confident that whatever discharged water, however it's treated, will not be allowed to be discharged if it affects Silver Bow Creek," Greene said. Perhaps the community's biggest concern is that there is no strategy for the Berkeley Pit beyond keeping the water from reaching the critical level. Daily and the Restore Our Creek coalition members said the plan only ensures that Butte will remain a Superfund site forever. That would be unusual for a program meant to permanently clean places polluted by hazardous pollutants — cleanups of nearly 400 sites across the nation have been completed and removed from the Superfund list as of December, according to the EPA. The EPA's Greene could not say whether Butte will always be a Superfund site, though he said there will always be some form of operation maintenance for the treatment plant plan. "That's a tough question," he said. "I guess Superfund is going to be there for a long time."

 Caption Close PALOCH, South Sudan (AP) — The oil industry in South Sudan has left a landscape pocked with hundreds of open waste pits, the water and soil contaminated with toxic chemicals and heavy metals, according to four environmental reports obtained by The Associated Press. The reports also describe alarming birth defects, miscarriages and other health problems among residents of the region and soldiers who have been stationed there. Abui Mou Kueth’s infant son, Ping, was born with six fingers on both hands, one stunted leg, a deformed foot and kidney swelling. “I was shocked the first time I saw the baby,” she said, cradling him in her arms. “I am worried about his future.” The Associated Press obtained the reports and supporting documents from people with close knowledge of the oil operations, one of whom works in the industry. They’ve never been released publicly. “South Sudan is running one of the dirtiest and poorest managed oil operations on the planet," said Egbert Wesselink, the former head of a European coalition of more than 50 non-profit organizations focused on the impacts of the country's oil sector. "I don’t think there’s a single major industrial operation on earth that’s getting away with this,” he said. There’s been no clear link established between the pollution and the health problems. But community leaders and lawmakers in the oil-rich areas in Upper Nile and Unity states accuse South Sudan's government and the two main oil consortiums, the Chinese-led Dar Petroleum Operating Co. and the Greater Pioneer Operating Co., of neglecting the issue and trying to silence those who have tried to expose the problem. An AP reporter was detained and questioned by government officials and government security forces working on behalf of the oil companies. Neither company responded to multiple requests for comment on the reports, and did not answer detailed questions sent by email and text from AP. The reports show that the government and the oil companies have been aware for years that contamination from drilling could be causing severe health problems, but little has been done to clean up the mess. WASTE PITS, BIRTH DEFECTS The oil rich area around Paloch, a city in Upper Nile state, is dotted with exposed pools of toxic water. A chemical junkyard in Gumry town, about 45 minutes from Paloch, was strewn with overflowing containers of black sludge that seeped into the ground and were surrounded by toxic waste, when an AP reporter visited in September 2018. "We're losing children," said Nyaweir Ayik Monyuak, chairman of the Women's Association in Melut. The 43-year-old lost two children of her own between 2008 and 2011. She and a dozen other women, crowded on a tattered L-shaped sofa in a dimly lit shed in Melut, told harrowing stories. Six had lost babies in the last 10 years. And all of them knew someone who had struggled to conceive, had miscarriages or had given birth to a child with deformities such as stunted limbs or concave skulls. THE STUDIES The two earliest surveys were performed in 2013 and 2016  by South Sudan’s government. They found oil pollution across the region and soil and water samples showed contamination, including mercury levels in the water were seven times what is permissible under U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standards. Local residents reported increased miscarriages, stillbirths and incidents of “malformed newborn babies” that didn’t survive, and soldiers stationed there were also falling ill. In July 2018, Greater Pioneer - which is comprised of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corp., the Malaysian state-owned Petronas as well as South Sudanese and Indian drillers -- commissioned a study that found significant oil spillage and water pollution at the waste treatment facility at some oil operations that had been abandoned during the civil war. A November 2018 report, commissioned by Dar Petroleum, found "extremely high” levels of hydrocarbons -- chemicals such as benzene that make up oil and natural gas and can cause serious health effects. It also documented 650 waste pits filled with water contaminated with arsenic and lead, and millions of liters of water contaminated with drilling chemicals sitting in ponds. South Sudan’s oil ministry instructed Dar Petroleum to move ahead with the proposed clean-up, according to a December 2018 letter seen by the AP. But Dar Petroleum — a consortium that includes China’s state-owned China National Petroleum and Sinopec, along with companies in Malaysia and Egypt and South Sudan’s state-owned oil company — never acted, according to two people with close knowledge of the oil operations in the area who didn’t want to be named for fear of their safety. AP sent detailed questions to China National Petroleum Corp. and Sinopec, but neither company responded. ‘PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY’ There is no definitive proof that the pollution caused the health problems. South Sudan’s crippling five-year civil war killed almost 400,000 people, displaced millions and plunged pockets of the country into famine. But Rick Steiner, an oil pollution adviser in Alaska, said there is substantial medical literature linking hydrocarbon exposure with birth defects. “The pollution is a public health and environmental emergency,” he said. South Sudan’s petroleum minister, Awow Daniel Chuang, said until there's scientific evidence tying health problems to oil pollution, no conclusions should be drawn. In July 2019, the Greater Pioneer Operating Company flew baby Ping and his parents to Nairobi, Kenya, and then to Berlin for what they thought would be medical treatment. Ping’s father, Cornelius Mayak Geer, says the company told him that they would first do tests to determine if Ping’s deformities were tied to oil pollution. If they found a link, Geer says they told him, they would pay for treatment. But the family returned from Berlin last month after loads of tests, but no treatment for the baby. Geer said the company told him the child’s problems were genetic, and not caused by oil pollution. But they never shared any test results with him. “The baby still cries day and night because of the pain and not feeling well,” he said. "They're just buying time until the baby dies. Environmental experts say there is little incentive for multinational companies to do anything because it is easy to get away with things in impoverished countries like South Sudan. Oil accounts for almost all the country’s exports, according to the World Bank. And South Sudan is trying to revive its economy by expanding the industry. "No one's really watching. The government is neither willing nor able to monitor and enforce its own environmental laws,” said Luke Patey, senior researcher studying China's oil investments in Africa at the Danish Institute for International Studies. He said the result is “a vicious cycle of negligence.”

 A vast array of pharmaceuticals -- including antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormones -- have been found in the drinking water supplies of at least 41 million Americans, an Associated Press investigation shows. To be sure, the concentrations of these pharmaceuticals are tiny, measured in quantities of parts per billion or trillion, far below the levels of a medical dose. Also, utilities insist their water is safe. But the presence of so many prescription drugs -- and over-the-counter medicines like acetaminophen and ibuprofen -- in so much of our drinking water is heightening worries among scientists of long-term consequences to human health. In the course of a five-month inquiry, the AP discovered that drugs have been detected in the drinking water supplies of 24 major metropolitan areas -- from Southern California to Northern New Jersey, from Detroit to Louisville, Ky. Water providers rarely disclose results of pharmaceutical screenings, unless pressed, the AP found. For example, the head of a group representing major California suppliers said the public "doesn't know how to interpret the information" and might be unduly alarmed. How do the drugs get into the water? People take pills. Their bodies absorb some of the medication, but the rest of it passes through and is flushed down the toilet. The wastewater is treated before it is discharged into reservoirs, rivers or lakes. Then, some of the water is cleansed again at drinking water treatment plants and piped to consumers. But most treatments do not remove all drug residue. And while researchers do not yet understand the exact risks from decades of persistent exposure to random combinations of low levels of pharmaceuticals, recent studies -- which have gone virtually unnoticed by the general public -- have found alarming effects on human cells and wildlife. "We recognize it is a growing concern and we're taking it very seriously," said Benjamin H. Grumbles, assistant administrator for water at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Members of the AP National Investigative Team reviewed hundreds of scientific reports, analyzed federal drinking water databases, visited environmental study sites and treatment plants and interviewed more than 230 officials, academics and scientists. They also surveyed the nation's 50 largest cities and a dozen other major water providers, as well as smaller community water providers in all 50 states. Here are some of the key test results obtained by the AP: --Officials in Philadelphia said testing there discovered 56 pharmaceuticals or byproducts in treated drinking water, including medicines for pain, infection, high cholesterol, asthma, epilepsy, mental illness and heart problems. Sixty-three pharmaceuticals or byproducts were found in the city's watersheds. --Anti-epileptic and anti-anxiety medications were detected in a portion of the treated drinking water for 18.5 million people in Southern California. --Researchers at the U.S. Geological Survey analyzed a Passaic Valley Water Commission drinking water treatment plant, which serves 850,000 people in Northern New Jersey, and found a metabolized angina medicine and the mood-stabilizing carbamazepine in drinking water. --A sex hormone was detected in San Francisco's drinking water. --The drinking water for Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas tested positive for six pharmaceuticals. --Three medications, including an antibiotic, were found in drinking water supplied to Tucson, Ariz. The situation is undoubtedly worse than suggested by the positive test results in the major population centers documented by the AP. The federal government doesn't require any testing and hasn't set safety limits for drugs in water. Of the 62 major water providers contacted, the drinking water for only 28 was tested. Among the 34 that haven't: Houston, Chicago, Miami, Baltimore, Phoenix, Boston and New York City's Department of Environmental Protection, which delivers water to 9 million people. Some providers screen only for one or two pharmaceuticals, leaving open the possibility that others are present. The AP's investigation also indicates that watersheds, the natural sources of most of the nation's water supply, also are contaminated. Tests were conducted in the watersheds of 35 of the 62 major providers surveyed by the AP, and pharmaceuticals were detected in 28. Yet officials in six of those 28 metropolitan areas said they did not go on to test their drinking water -- Fairfax, Va.; Montgomery County in Maryland; Omaha, Neb.; Oklahoma City; Santa Clara, Calif., and New York City. The New York state health department and the USGS tested the source of the city's water, upstate. They found trace concentrations of heart medicine, infection fighters, estrogen, anti-convulsants, a mood stabilizer and a tranquilizer. City water officials declined repeated requests for an interview. In a statement, they insisted that "New York City's drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system" -- regulations that do not address trace pharmaceuticals. In several cases, officials at municipal or regional water providers told the AP that pharmaceuticals had not been detected, but the AP obtained the results of tests conducted by independent researchers that showed otherwise. For example, water department officials in New Orleans said their water had not been tested for pharmaceuticals, but a Tulane University researcher and his students have published a study that found the pain reliever naproxen, the sex hormone estrone and the anti-cholesterol drug byproduct clofibric acid in treated drinking water. Of the 28 major metropolitan areas where tests were performed on drinking water supplies, only Albuquerque; Austin, Texas; and Virginia Beach, Va.; said tests were negative. The drinking water in Dallas has been tested, but officials are awaiting results. Arlington, Texas, acknowledged that traces of a pharmaceutical were detected in its drinking water but cited post-9/11 security concerns in refusing to identify the drug. The AP also contacted 52 small water providers -- one in each state, and two each in Missouri and Texas -- that serve communities with populations around 25,000. All but one said their drinking water had not been screened for pharmaceuticals; officials in Emporia, Kan., refused to answer AP's questions, also citing post-9/11 issues. Rural consumers who draw water from their own wells aren't in the clear either, experts say. The Stroud Water Research Center, in Avondale, Pa., has measured water samples from New York City's upstate watershed for caffeine, a common contaminant that scientists often look for as a possible signal for the presence of other pharmaceuticals. Though more caffeine was detected at suburban sites, researcher Anthony Aufdenkampe was struck by the relatively high levels even in less populated areas. He suspects it escapes from failed septic tanks, maybe with other drugs. " Septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail," Aufdenkampe said. Even users of bottled water and home filtration systems don't necessarily avoid exposure. Bottlers, some of which simply repackage tap water, do not typically treat or test for pharmaceuticals, according to the industry's main trade group. The same goes for the makers of home filtration systems. Contamination is not confined to the United States. More than 100 different pharmaceuticals have been detected in lakes, rivers, reservoirs and streams throughout the world. Studies have detected pharmaceuticals in waters throughout Asia, Australia, Canada and Europe -- even in Swiss lakes and the North Sea. For example, in Canada, a study of 20 Ontario drinking water treatment plants by a national research institute found nine different drugs in water samples. Japanese health officials in December called for human health impact studies after detecting prescription drugs in drinking water at seven different sites. In the United States, the problem isn't confined to surface waters. Pharmaceuticals also permeate aquifers deep underground, source of 40 percent of the nation's water supply. Federal scientists who drew water in 24 states from aquifers near contaminant sources such as landfills and animal feed lots found minuscule levels of hormones, antibiotics and other drugs. Perhaps it's because Americans have been taking drugs -- and flushing them unmetabolized or unused -- in growing amounts. Over the past five years, the number of U.S. prescriptions rose 12 percent to a record 3.7 billion, while nonprescription drug purchases held steady around 3.3 billion, according to IMS Health and The Nielsen Co. "People think that if they take a medication, their body absorbs it and it disappears, but of course that's not the case," said EPA scientist Christian Daughton, one of the first to draw attention to the issue of pharmaceuticals in water in the United States. Some drugs, including widely used cholesterol fighters, tranquilizers and anti-epileptic medications, resist modern drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. Plus, the EPA says there are no sewage treatment systems specifically engineered to remove pharmaceuticals. One technology, reverse osmosis, removes virtually all pharmaceutical contaminants but is very expensive for large-scale use and leaves several gallons of polluted water for every one that is made drinkable. Another issue: There's evidence that adding chlorine, a common process in conventional drinking water treatment plants, makes some pharmaceuticals more toxic. Human waste isn't the only source of contamination. Cattle, for example, are given ear implants that provide a slow release of trenbolone, an anabolic steroid used by some bodybuilders, which causes cattle to bulk up. But not all the trenbolone circulating in a steer is metabolized. A German study showed 10 percent of the steroid passed right through the animals. Water sampled downstream of a Nebraska feedlot had steroid levels four times as high as the water taken upstream. Male fathead minnows living in that downstream area had low testosterone levels and small heads. Other veterinary drugs also play a role. Pets are now treated for arthritis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, allergies, dementia, and even obesity -- sometimes with the same drugs as humans. The inflation-adjusted value of veterinary drugs rose by 8 percent, to $5.2 billion, over the past five years, according to an analysis of data from the Animal Health Institute. Ask the pharmaceutical industry whether the contamination of water supplies is a problem, and officials will tell you no. " Based on what we now know, I would say we find there's little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health," said microbiologist Thomas White, a consultant for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. But at a conference last summer, Mary Buzby -- director of environmental technology for drug maker Merck & Co. Inc. -- said: "There's no doubt about it, pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds, in the small concentrations that they're at, could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms." Recent laboratory research has found that small amounts of medication have affected human embryonic kidney cells, human blood cells and human breast cancer cells. The cancer cells proliferated too quickly; the kidney cells grew too slowly; and the blood cells showed biological activity associated with inflammation. Also, pharmaceuticals in waterways are damaging wildlife across the nation and around the globe, research shows. Notably, male fish are being feminized, creating egg yolk proteins, a process usually restricted to females. Pharmaceuticals also are affecting sentinel species at the foundation of the pyramid of life -- such as earth worms in the wild and zooplankton in the laboratory, studies show. Some scientists stress that the research is extremely limited, and there are too many unknowns. They say, though, that the documented health problems in wildlife are disconcerting. "It brings a question to people's minds that if the fish were affected ... might there be a potential problem for humans?" EPA research biologist Vickie Wilson told the AP. "It could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something. We haven't gotten far enough along." With limited research funds, said Shane Snyder, research and development project manager at the Southern Nevada Water Authority, a greater emphasis should be put on studying the effects of drugs in water. "I think it's a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there, and so little is being spent on human health," said Snyder. "They need to just accept that these things are everywhere -- every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there. It's time for the EPA to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects, both human and environmental." To the degree that the EPA is focused on the issue, it appears to be looking at detection. Grumbles acknowledged that just late last year the agency developed three new methods to "detect and quantify pharmaceuticals" in wastewater. "We realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations," he said. "We're going to be able to learn a lot more." While Grumbles said the EPA had analyzed 287 pharmaceuticals for possible inclusion on a draft list of candidates for regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, he said only one, nitroglycerin, was on the list. Nitroglycerin can be used as a drug for heart problems, but the key reason it's being considered is its widespread use in making explosives. So much is unknown. Many independent scientists are skeptical that trace concentrations will ultimately prove to be harmful to humans. Confidence about human safety is based largely on studies that poison lab animals with much higher amounts. There's growing concern in the scientific community, meanwhile, that certain drugs -- or combinations of drugs -- may harm humans over decades because water, unlike most specific foods, is consumed in sizable amounts every day. Our bodies may shrug off a relatively big one-time dose, yet suffer from a smaller amount delivered continuously over a half century, perhaps subtly stirring allergies or nerve damage. Pregnant women, the elderly and the very ill might be more sensitive. Many concerns about chronic low-level exposure focus on certain drug classes: chemotherapy that can act as a powerful poison; hormones that can hamper reproduction or development; medicines for depression and epilepsy that can damage the brain or change behavior; antibiotics that can allow human germs to mutate into more dangerous forms; pain relievers and blood-pressure diuretics. For several decades, federal environmental officials and nonprofit watchdog environmental groups have focused on regulated contaminants -- pesticides, lead, PCBs -- which are present in higher concentrations and clearly pose a health risk. However, some experts say medications may pose a unique danger because, unlike most pollutants, they were crafted to act on the human body. "These are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations. That's what pharmaceuticals do. So when they get out to the environment, it should not be a shock to people that they have effects," says zoologist John Sumpter at Brunel University in London, who has studied trace hormones, heart medicine and other drugs. And while drugs are tested to be safe for humans, the timeframe is usually over a matter of months, not a lifetime. Pharmaceuticals also can produce side effects and interact with other drugs at normal medical doses. That's why -- aside from therapeutic doses of fluoride injected into potable water supplies -- pharmaceuticals are prescribed to people who need them, not delivered to everyone in their drinking water. "We know we are being exposed to other people's drugs through our drinking water, and that can't be good," says Dr. David Carpenter, who directs the Institute for Health and the Environment of the State University of New York at Albany.

 NEW ORLEANS By CAIN BURDEAU Associated Press It could take hours or it could take months to stop a 42,000-gallon-a-day oil leak polluting the Gulf of Mexico at the site of a wrecked drilling platform. Whether the environmental threat grows many times bigger depends on whether the oil company can turn the well completely off. Crews are using robot submarines to activate valves at the well head in hopes of cutting off the leak, and limit, which threatens the Gulf Coast's fragile ecosystem of shrimp, fish, birds and coral. If the effort fails, they'll have to start drilling again. The submarine work will take 24 to 36 hours, Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production, said Sunday afternoon. "I should emphasize this is a highly complex operation being performed at 5,000 feet below the surface and it may not be successful," he said. Oil continued to leak nearly a mile underwater Sunday at the site where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on Tuesday. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead. For the second consecutive day, high waves prevented boats and equipment from going out to clean the spill. Airplanes sprayed chemicals to break up the oil. The spill initially appeared to be easily manageable after the oil rig sank Thursday about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast, but it has turned into a more serious environmental problem. Officials on Saturday discovered the leak, which is spewing as much as 1,000 barrels -- or 42,000 gallons -- of oil each day. The oil spill has been growing -- officials said the oily sheen on the surface of the gulf covered about 600 square miles Sunday. The environmental damage would be especially serious if it reaches land. The spill was still about 70 miles from the mainland, but only about 30 miles from an important chain of barrier islands known as the Chandeleurs. The islands, part of a national wildlife refuge, are an important nesting ground for pelicans and other sea birds. They have been under serious threat since Hurricane Katrina washed out much of the sand there. "Katrina did kick it pretty good, but they have been growing back," said Greg Thornton, the 52-year-old owner of Horn Island and Due South Charters in Biloxi. He takes fishing parties out to the islands. Looking at wind patterns on his computer, which showed favorable conditions until Thursday, Thornton held out hope that the oil could be contained. "We might have some trouble if they don't get the boom around it and stop it from spreading," he said. The spill so far appears to be small relative to some major oil accidents. The Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989 -- the worst oil spill in U.S. history. "It has the potential to be pretty serious, but at 1,000 barrels a day, if it comes to the surface they'll probably be able to contain it and vacuum it up," said James Cowan, an oceanography and coastal sciences professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. The company is planning to collect leaking oil on the ocean bottom by lowering a large dome to capture the oil and using pipes and hoses to pump it into a vessel on the surface, said Suttles, the BP executive. "That system has been deployed in shallower water," he said, "but it has never been deployed at 5,000 feet of water, so we have to be careful." The robot submarines are attempting to close off the flow of oil by activating a shutoff device at the well head known as a blowout preventer. In case that doesn't work, BP PLC, which leased the Deepwater, moved another deepwater rig, the DD3, toward the explosion site. If necessary, the new rig would drill relief wells into the damaged well underneath the ocean floor. That could take several months. Benton F. Baugh, who holds numerous patents for blowout preventer parts, said the subs should be able to do the job. "If they can't get it closed off, something really unusual happened," said Baugh, president of Radoil Inc. in Houston and a National Academy of Engineering member. Kenneth E. Arnold, an offshore production facility expert and another member of the engineering academy, said drilling a relief well is not an easy task. "You have to intersect the well," he said. "Sometimes you have to drill through the steel, and that's what happened in Australia. It took them three times before they were successful." He was referring to a blowout on the West Atlas rig in the Timor Sea last August. It wasn't until November that mud could be pumped through a relief well to shut off the deepwater spigot. The oil spill has resulted in major environmental damage along the coast of East Timor and Indonesia. Coast Guard officials said weather conditions for the next three days would help keep the Gulf spill away from the coast. Mark Schexnayder, a regional coastal adviser at the Louisiana Sea Grant, said the oil spill had the potential to do long-term damage to the coastal environment. The location of the spill is crisscrossed by marine species, including sperm whales, whale sharks, sea turtles, grouper and porpoises, he said. "We're a month away from opening up the inshore shrimp season, crab season is just getting underway," he said. "It could close oyster beds." BP said it has activated an extensive oil spill response, including the robot submarines, 700 workers, four planes and 32 vessels to mop up the spill and spray chemicals that will disperse the oil. The Marine Spill Response Corp., an energy industry cleanup consortium, also brought in equipment. So far, crews have retrieved about 1,143 barrels of oily water. Complicating efforts to stop the leak is the well head's depth at 5,000 feet underwater, said Lars Herbst, the regional director for the U.S. Minerals Management Service, which regulates oil rigs. Leaks have been fixed at similar depths before, but the process is difficult, he said. The explosion appeared to be a blowout, in which natural gas or oil forces its way up a well pipe and smashes the equipment. But precisely what went wrong is under investigation.

 ON THE GULF OF MEXICO Associated Press Ships relaying the sights and sounds from BP's broken oil well stood fast Friday as the leftovers of Tropical Storm Bonnie blew straight for the spill site, threatening to force a full evacuation that would leave engineers clueless about whether a makeshift cap on the gusher was holding. Vessels connected to deep-sea robots equipped with cameras and seismic devices would be among the last to flee and would ride out the rough weather if possible, retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said. "If conditions allow, they will remain through the passage of the storm," Allen said in New Orleans. Bonnie made landfall south of Miami early Friday as a feeble tropical storm with top sustained winds of 40 mph. It broke apart as it crossed Florida and was a tropical depression as it moved into the Gulf, but forecasters expected it to strengthen slightly and roll over the spill site around midday Saturday. Some of the dozens of vessels working at the well site were leaving Friday evening. By daybreak, all but a handful, including those providing video images, were expected to remain. Allen said individual captains would decide when to leave, based on weather conditions. The ships holding the robots would be among the first to return if forecasts force them to leave, but they could be gone for up to two days, said Allen, the federal government's spill chief. The mechanical plug that has mostly contained the oil for eight days will be left closed, Allen said. But if the robots are reeled in, the only way officials will know whether the cap has failed will be if oil pooling on the surface appears in satellite and aerial views -- provided the clouds aren't too thick. Audio surveillance gear left behind could tell BP whether the well is still stable, but scientists won't be able to listen to the recordings until the ships return. Allen expressed increasing confidence in the experimental cap despite a few leaks that initially worried government experts. Scientists say even a severe storm shouldn't affect the plug, nearly a mile beneath the ocean surface 40 miles from the Louisiana coast. "There's almost no chance it'll have any impact on the well head or the cap because it's right around 5,000 feet deep and even the largest waves won't get down that far," said Don Van Nieuwenhuise, director of professional geoscience programs at the University of Houston. Crews of other vessels, including one boring the tunnel meant to kill the flow of crude for good, spent Friday hauling in their gear and getting out of the storm's way. Workers were pulling up a mile of pipe in 40-to-60-foot sections and laying it on deck of the drilling rig so they could move to safer water, probably to the southwest flank of the storm. "Preservation of life and preservation of equipment are our highest priorities," said Allen, a veteran of the Coast Guard's rescue mission after Hurricane Katrina. Shell Oil also was evacuating its operations in the Gulf, moving out more than 600 workers and shutting down production at all but one well sheltered safely in Mobile Bay. At the spill site, the water no longer looks thick with gooey tar. But the oil is still there beneath the surface, staining the hulls of boats motoring around in it. Strong winds and waves could help break up the oil further, but a storm surge also might push it into sensitive marsh areas along the coast. "Those are two opposite consequences and we're prepared to move out and aggressively attack this once the threat has passed through," Allen said. The foul weather has stalled progress toward killing the well and could delay until mid-August the sealing of the nearly two-mile underground shaft using mud and cement, Allen and BP say. BP had hoped to finish drilling a relief tunnel Friday, but had to plug it Wednesday to prepare for the storm. On the tiny resort island of Grand Isle off the southeast Louisiana coast workers packed up the oil removal operation, tearing down tents, tying down clean boom and loading oil-soaked boom into large containers so it won't pollute the area if the storm causes flooding. "Part of our severe weather plan is to remove all the equipment from the beach," said Coast Guard Lt. Cmd. Nan Bangs. "We don't want to take a chance on something damaging the sand berm or the houses along there." Before the cap was attached and closed a week ago, the broken well spewed 94 million to 184 million gallons into the Gulf after the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20, killing 11 workers. BP is likely to be fined per gallon spilled, although determining that could be difficult. Concentrations of underwater oil at least doubled last month, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Researchers at the University of South Florida said Friday they have the first scientific proof that two giant plumes of oil beneath the surface of the Gulf came from the broken well. BP initially denied the plumes even existed.

 IF THE road to hell is paved with good intentions, vehicles traveling that dismal highway are surely fueled with MTBE- laced gasoline. In an effort to reduce pollution, the Since then, MTBE has been declared a suspected human carcinogen. It is found in a quarter of the nation's urban wells and in many of California's wells, reservoirs, lakes, streams and other sources of drinking water. In a two-part Chronicle report last week, staff writers "In California," they wrote, "MTBE has contaminated 10,000 shallow groundwater sites, including 1,000 in the Bay Area." A growing body of evidence -- including a recent comprehensive study by The UC researchers said MTBE poses serious enough risks to human health and the environment that it should be phased out of California gasoline. Yet even though oil companies have the technology to produce gasoline without MTBE and still meet state and federal air quality standards, the EPA refuses to allow California to reduce MTBE levels, insisting that more data is needed for a properly informed decision. Meanwhile, MTBE is leaking from storage tanks, imperiling water supplies and costing California motorists an extra $12 million to $34 million a week at the gas pump for a potentially poisonous fuel additive.

 Editor - The Chronicle's May 12 editorial ("A blight on 'the green city' ") has done a great disservice to those of us who suffer daily from the toxic impacts of the polluting Potrero power plant. The members of the neighborhood-based Power Plant Task Force - all residents of the Potrero Hill, Dogpatch and Bayview communities - have worked tirelessly for more than seven years to close the plant. For more than seven years, we have lobbied California regulators to allow the plant to close without requiring the operation of "peaking" plants as a replacement power source. Unfortunately, every single one of the so-called "alternatives" cited by opponents of the plan to close the plant has been dismissed. We certainly appreciate the concern of those who recently decided they care about the health of our neighborhood children and families. But those of us who have worked to close this aging power plant for years understand that the only viable plan is to build and operate the much cleaner combustion turbines. They will run less than half the time and emit far less pollution. We strongly support more solar, wind, new transmission, "reconductoring" and energy efficiency. But none of those - alone or together - will close the Potrero power plant. Responsible leaders who say they care about our community's health should support the combustion turbine project now. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= opinion&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22PHILIP+De+ANDRADE%22">PHILIP De ANDRADE</a> San Francisco Editor - Various city departments and citizens advisory committees labored for more than five years on a balanced approach to closing the Mirant Potrero power plant with city built and operated "peaker" plants.

Supervisor The Chronicle should be well aware that to re-permit an electric power project in California takes years. If the city were to start over, the existing antiquated Mirant plant would continue to operate indefinitely, polluting the air and the bay water.

I see community activities, such as "Starry Nights in the Park, " Halloween parades on downtown streets, Christmas tree lightings that people actually attend, a farmers' market and a multitude of other activities. I had the chance to go back to Novato Saturday. What I saw there made me feel very sad. I saw the streets littered with weeds and overgrown shrubbery, uneven payments and homes that looked tired and old, and not at all well maintained. This is in Marin County, where the homes are selling for significantly more than here in Brentwood. Yes, Brentwood is having a hard time of it, but would I move back to Novato? Not in a minute. I see growth and vitality here and I, for one, am happy to be a part of it. My hope for Brentwood is to get back on track and continue to be the charming town that I chose to live in.

 <b> THE ISSUE:</b> A new gas drilling process sounds like it holds promise. <b>THE STAKES:</b > We need to be sure it's really as great as its public relations. It seems simple enough: Before you do something underground, be sure you're not going to ruin a vital natural resource — like drinking water, for starters. And get a plan in place for any accident that may happen. So before New York opens its arms to yet another next big thing in gas drilling, the industry owes the public a more substantial assurance than, essentially, "Don't worry. Trust us." That new next big thing is propane gel fracking, which, in theory, sounds great. Of course, if you watch only the ads put out by the gas drilling industry, horizontal high-volume hydraulic fracturing sounds pretty great, too. We'd like to know that there has been a higher level of analysis here than one done by an advertising agency. Much as the industry would undoubtedly like to fast track the process, we expect the state Both these techniques differ from traditional drilling because they drill not only down but horizontally, allowing wells to draw gas from a wide area underground. Both involve fracturing rock to release trapped gas. Beyond that, they are markedly different. Hydrofracking breaks rock with a high-pressure solution of millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals. Questions about the process include its potential to pollute groundwater and, significantly, how the fracturing solution, which picks up radioactivity in the deep Earth, will safely be handled and treated. Without adequate treatment, which it's not clear the state has the capacity to provide, there's worry about long-range damage so much polluted water might do to lakes, streams and other surface water resources. Propane gel fracking, a new process, appears to have some notable advantages over hydrofracking from an environmental point of view. The gel is said to turn to vapor underground and can be collected, reused or resold as propane gas, the same kind of gas found in home barbecue grills. It is also said not to carry back to the surface any drilling chemicals or radioactivity. The technique has been used so far on a limited basis in Canada and tested in a few wells in this country. It's still awaiting a U.S. patent. To comment: It is not a knee-jerk reaction to ask that the Department of Environmental Conservation move slowly and transparently on this. We've heard upbeat assurances of safety before from the gas industry, even as companies tried to keep the list of toxic chemicals in their fracking formulas secret, and downplayed concerns about the toxicity of the solutions, saying there was nothing worse in the mix than what you'd find in a household cabinet. Sounds innocuous until you consider what, indeed, is likely to be under the typical American sink. DEC says that once it receives a formal application for a propane fracking project, it will do a full environmental review. While there's already early grumbling and suspicion about propane fracking among environmental activists, we'd urge both them and the industry to let DEC do its job. This should be about science, not who has the most popular argument. And with a current glut of natural gas on the market — so much that drillers are said to be scaling back their operations because they're not profitable enough — there is clearly no rush for DEC to get this done tomorrow. Better to get it right.

A report released last year details increased health risks <strong>To the editor,</strong> In Illinois, we have many things to be proud of including our scenic rivers and lakes that drive tourism and provide access to clean water. Unfortunately, these waterways are in danger with over 80 coal ash impoundments at open and closed coal plants across the state. In East Alton, Dynegy-Vistra’s shuttered Wood River Power Plant sits on a flood plain adjacent to the Mississippi River and contains coal ash storage ponds in which groundwater testing in wells nearby revealed unsafe levels of arsenic, boron, molybdenum, and sulfate. (See illinoiscoalash.org) According to the EPA, living near a wet coal ash storage pond is more dangerous than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. The toxins found in coal ash have been linked to organ disease, cancer, respiratory illness, neurological damage, and developmental disorders and reproductive problems. Dynegy-Vistra is planning to “cap and run” at Wood River, an approach where coal ash pits are covered with a cap that keeps out rain water but doesn’t stop leakage through unlined or inadequately lined bottoms, allowing toxins to leach into groundwater. This option also fails to stop groundwater from rising during times of heavy rain and flooding. Inadequate federal and state coal ash standards have left Illinois largely unprotected. What do we do? While coal ash removal is a national problem, there is opportunity in the Metro East to address this threat. You can add your voice at an EPA public hearing on April 30 at 6 p.m. in the Riverbender Community Center, 200 W. 3rd. Street in Alton. You can also contact your legislators and demand that they protect our health by stopping ongoing groundwater contamination and requiring responsible dry handling and disposal of coal ash, and ensuring that corporate polluters pay for needed clean up, not taxpayers. <strong>Toni Oplt</strong> <strong>Metro East Green Alliance</strong> — — Read a previous Telegraph story on the subject here:

It should have read the border stands between New York and its environmental degradation and destruction. Anyone who is on the fence regarding hydrofracking should visit our next-door neighbor and see the effects. The procedure is dirty and noisy as well as water-consuming and polluting. The short-term economic benefits are far outweighed by the potential for long-term harm done to the land, air and water. The gas and oil companies will make their millions and leave, as will many of the lease-rich farmers and landowners. The trickle-down economic benefits will temporarily provide a boost to area businesses. Area employment will go through a boom-and-bust period. The scarred landscape that is left after the last bit of oil and gas is extracted will take decades, if not centuries, to heal. For years, communities will struggle to repair the damages done to their water resources and infrastructure such as roads and bridges. My wife and I enjoy a bit of heaven on earth — a cabin and acreage in the beautiful Schoharie foothills. We have put the property under a conservation easement with the stipulation that gas and oil drilling will never be allowed. Much more than money, we value the rustling of leaves in the trees, the babbling rush of the crystal clear brook, the pristine valley view, the colorful variety of birds, the deer and turkeys wandering in the meadow and the taste of icy pure well water pumped from hundreds of feet below the ground. Many of these joys could be compromised by hydrofracking. We believe that most New Yorkers reflect our values and cherish the natural irreplaceable beauty of our state.

 HALLSTEAD, Pa. — On our small summertime farm, about eight miles south of the New York state line, my wife and I are smack-dab in the middle of hydraulic fracturing country. The fracking news from just north of us catches our attention every day. So do the trucks, noise and disruption it brings. Comparing the deliberate pace in New York to the quicker approvals that led to wholesale drilling in Pennsylvania gives me hope that the right decisions will be made, spurred by the wide range of environmental questions as well as the potential for serious income. This is no time to act in haste. Our farm is 19 miles from Dimock, the epicenter of drilling in the county and the town featured in "Gasland," the HBO documentary. A memorable scene comes when one homeowner turns on a faucet and ignites the methane flowing out along with the water. The area has been full of methane for decades, though, and my wife remembers stories of flaming faucets from well before fracking began. Four years ago, we signed a lease on our property to allow drilling. Everyone around us was on board, so it would have been foolish not to, since there's no escaping the widespread effects on life in an area riddled with wells and active drilling operations. New Yorkers would be well advised to consider that disruption as they debate fracking. Fracking uses huge amounts of water, most of it hauled by truck, that is laced with chemicals and sand and injected under very high pressure into shale formations to fracture the rock and release the gas. Some of the used fracking fluid is returned to the ground, into very deep and supposedly leakproof wells. Some is treated in plants to remove the dangerous stuff. Early on, some was dumped into the Susquehanna River and its tributaries. In Susquehanna County, drilling has changed almost everything. New York will be well advised to pay attention to quality of life as much as to pollution. Susquehanna's roads, many of them dirt, are pummeled daily by the noisy fleets of water trucks and show the wear. It is hard to chat with a friend on a street corner in Montrose, the county seat, because of the trucks. I counted 38 in 30 minutes one day last summer passing under the lone traffic signal in town. Housing in the county has been swamped by drill crews from out of town, making affordable housing for the locals hard to find. Unsightly mobile home parks have sprung up. Staging areas for well and pipeline operations look like D-Day launch sites. Susquehanna is a poor county. While having more jobs is great, much of the pay goes out of state. Gas companies have purchased a lot of goodwill with their generous donations, but they will not go on forever. Businesses supporting drilling have opened, but they also have limited lifetimes. Gov.

 To the Editor: The city of Norwalk has recently spent well more than $250,000 on Mary Austin Place in order to correct flooding and other detrimental effects caused by runoff from the very property proposed for development. If this project goes through, it will not only undo all the work that has been done but will set itself up as a future and major polluter of the Silvermine River. In addition, this 11-unit housing development (conservation?) will add at least 22 more cars coming and going daily. According to the developer's traffic engineer, this will not have any impact on traffic patterns. Let's do the math -- 22 (cars, daily) x 365 (days) -- draw your own conclusion. Furthermore, the traffic engineer suggested moving a 200-year-old stone wall for increased visibility upon exiting the property. If this doesn't influence quality of life and history along Silver-mine Avenue, then what does? Planning and Zoning should not always be seduced by more tax dollars. Norwalk already suffers from a self-imposed inferiority complex. This time around, let's set the bar higher and send a strong message to P&Z that community matters more than the almighty dollar. Saving Silvermine from one developers' greed is a step towards saving Norwalk from future exploitation. Lesley and John Kammerman Norwalk

A piece of land on the Peeler Ranch south of Pleasanton that the Peeler family says has been ruined by the San Miguel Electric Cooperative's coal-burning power plant and lignite mining operations is seen Coal is Texas’s second largest electricity producer after natural gas, but its trajectory is headed the opposite direction. Unlike gas, coal isn’t booming, but instead preparing to leave its legacy behind. After much of the air pollution dissipates and the surface mines get filled in, that legacy may be one of coal ash. For decades power companies have discarded this toxic byproduct of burning coal in the most convenient, and affordable, way possible: by dumping it into nearby pits or lagoons. <underscore class="character" displayname="underscore" name="underscore"><a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u= http-3A__www.environmentalintegrity.org_wp-2Dcontent_uploads_2019_01_Texas-2DCoal-2DAsh-2DReport.pdf&amp;d= DwMFAg&amp;c =B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&amp;r=5f9tYWRErROojfR18CFIpeD1a2PDGYMvwRyDaUUhMVsuvCy-toGmV4xtncffYDxk&amp;m= e6Y2OD2njnjsmsouMNahOIjfXKsxxOMCjDR6DIPDpxE&amp;s =BXL-- OrahWpiyoxGXPzh77RF4Fp4OUDAHZURBQwNq5w&amp;e=">A new report</a>
</underscore> The worst groundwater contamination in Texas from coal ash can be found south of San Antonio, at the San Miguel Electric Co-Op power plant near Jourdanton, according to utility data made public for the first time in 2018 because of new federal coal ash regulations. There, the groundwater beneath a cattle ranch owned for five generations by the Peeler family is being polluted by leakage from the power company’s three coal ash waste ponds. Arsenic (a carcinogen) is in the groundwater beneath the farm exceeding EPA’s maximum contaminant level by up to 12 times; and cadmium, which causes kidney and bone damage, exceeds safe levels by 130 fold, among other pollutants. “The toxic pollution leaking from these coal ash dumps is threatening our family’s ranch and our heritage,” said Jason Peeler, who helps run the Peeler Ranch. “We’ve asked the power company to stop polluting our land and clean up the mess. But their response has been to threaten to seize our land through eminent domain instead of cleaning it up. It’s outrageous — and an example of how coal ash pollution can cause real damage.” Here is the backstory. In 1953, the Peeler family leased a portion of their large property to allow surface mining for lignite coal; and later, the construction of a 400-megawatt coal-fired power plant by the San Miguel Co-Op. Under the terms of the lease agreement, after the mining stopped, the power company was supposed to clean up the mess and restore the land to a healthy condition. When the mining ended in 2004, however, the company failed to keep its promise, and instead kept using the land as a pit for the dumping of power plant’s ash waste. This dump is now leaking a plume of toxic chemicals into the groundwater under the Peeler ranch, poisoning the soil, killing vegetation, and likely causing a fish kill in a farm pond. To the family, it has been like watching a cancer spread slowly through a relative and not knowing how to cure it. The Peelers are in court with the San Miguel Co-Op, fighting for the survival of their 25,000-acre ranch. Their worst fear is the company’s threat to claim eminent domain authority and attempt to condemn about a third of the ranch that is contaminated, instead of investing the money to clean up the pollution. Were this to happen, the Peelers would lose a chunk of their family history. Texas has long been sensitive to the needs of the energy industry. But it also proudly champions property rights. Across the state, property owners like the Peelers will witness the gradual destruction of one of Texas’ most precious resources — clean, drinkable groundwater — if state regulators fail to stand up to the threat of coal ash contamination. Stronger state regulations are needed to require the cleanup of leaking ash dumps. And, in the long run, Texas needs to continue its shift away from coal and towards more clean energy sources such as wind and solar. <italic class="character" displayname="italic" name="italic"></italic> Ilan Levin is the Texas Director of the Environmental Integrity Project.

 ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) — Federal environmental regulators say testing of scores of drinking-water wells in a northeastern Pennsylvania village has failed to turn up unsafe levels of contamination, providing ammunition to a gas driller that denies it polluted the aquifer with hazardous chemicals while prompting accusations the government is distorting the data. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released test results for an additional 12 homes on Friday and said they "did not show levels of contaminants that would give EPA reason to take further action. " It was the fourth and final release of data for homes in Dimock, a rural Susquehanna County community that's found itself in the middle of a passionate debate over the safety of drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in deep rock formations like the Marcellus Shale. The EPA testing is only a snapshot of the highly changeable aquifer and will not be the final word on the health of the water supply. But pro-industry groups and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., the Houston-based driller whose faulty gas wells were previously found to have leaked methane into the aquifer, assert the test results justify their position that Dimock's water is safe. "Cabot is pleased that EPA has now reached the same conclusion of Cabot and state and local authorities resulting from the collection of more than 10,000 pages of hard data — that the water in Dimock meets all regulatory standards," spokesman George Stark said Friday. But residents who are suing Cabot and anti-drilling activists say the EPA has issued a series of misleading statements on what the tests show. They say some of the wells had a combination of chemicals, metals, gases and salts that suggest the influence of drilling and fracking; that drinking-water standards have not been established for some of the toxic substances that turned up in the wells; and that testing also revealed high and sometimes explosive levels of methane in about a third of the wells. Opponents also raised technical concerns about the data. "The fact remains, EPA's own tests have already vindicated the long-standing allegations of water contamination and clearly shows that the water of the affected residents is unfit for human consumption," said Claire Sandberg, executive director of Water Defense, an anti-drilling organization. The group distributed a statement from Ron Bishop, a drilling opponent and chemist at the State University of New York at Oneonta, that said many of the wells are "significantly contaminated" with pollutants that threaten human health. EPA spokesman Roy Seneca defended the quality of the testing, saying "the agency has used the best available scientific data to provide clarity to Dimock residents and address their concerns about the safety of their drinking water." The EPA sampled the well water of a total of 61 homes, though it released data on only 59 because regulators were unable to contact two of the homeowners. The agency said it will resample four wells where earlier testing by Cabot and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection showed unsafe levels of contaminants. The EPA is also planning to follow up with an additional three homeowners who want their wells tested. "Once all of the sample results are complete, we will conduct a comprehensive review to determine if there are any trends or patterns in the data as it relates to home well water quality," Seneca said. State environmental regulators previously determined that Cabot contaminated the aquifer underneath homes along Carter Road in Dimock with explosive levels of methane gas, although they later determined the company had met its obligations under a consent agreement and allowed Cabot to stop delivering bulk and bottled water last fall. The EPA said Friday one of the 12 water wells was found to have an elevated level of methane. The agency notified the homeowner, state officials and the Susquehanna County Emergency Management Agency. Amid the squabble over test results, the Dimock plaintiffs, who sued Cabot in 2009, appear to have quietly entered into settlement talks with the company. One of their lawyers, Tate Kunkle, mentioned "progressing settlement negotiations" in a court filing late last month.

I fail to see a bright side. I believe that businesses and business properties are given leniency and consideration by the Harris County Appraisal District as to their property taxes, with the burden therefore increasing yearly for homeowners. Recently, an article ("Sky-high view, no commute calling many downtown," Page A1, March 20) noted a subsidy of $15,000 a unit for downtown apartment developers contributed by a governmental entity. I also see that many buildings in my neighborhood and downtown remain vacant for long periods of time, and wonder whether homeowners are again being soaked for what may be uncollectible tax revenues on these properties. <strong><a href="/search/?action = search&amp;channel= opinion%2Fletters&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Kathryn+W.+Kelber%22">Kathryn W.

If indeed all shipping had been halted, it looks like the area between the jetties are a natural pinch point (narrowest) in the whole system. Possibly it could have kept the oil out of the Gulf and prevented it from traveling south toward Matagorda. With over 100,000 feet of floating boom deployed at Port O'Connor as a preventative measure, it seems like the approximate half mile required between the two jetties was a viable pre-emptive option. <strong><a href="/search/?action = search&amp;channel= opinion%2Fletters&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Robert+King%22">Robert King</a>, Spring</strong>  <em style="font-weight: bold;">Countywide </em> Regarding the editorial "Next steps" (Page B6, Saturday), while I applaud the efforts of Houston Mayor <strong> Violet White, Houston</strong>  <em style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="/search/?action = search&amp;channel= opinion%2Fletters&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Hobby+Lobby%22">Hobby Lobby</a> </em > Regarding "Hobby Lobby case just another assault on our freedoms" (Page B10, Sunday), The Hobby Lobby lawsuit is not to prohibit birth control measures but is about limiting their responsibility to include abortion-producing drugs or devices.

 San Francisco taxpayers and water ratepayers once again have been fleeced of millions of dollars as a result of mismanagement at the city's once highly regarded Lake Merced. In 2011, the The misguided management structure at Lake Merced, where the SFPUC and Recreation and Park have overlapping and ambiguous responsibilities, led to the financial situation at the lake today that is more polluted than the water. For years, we have urged the commission, the owner of the lake, to assume sole management. After spending $3.2 million of ratepayer and taxpayer money for a boathouse, you would think the public would have gotten a full-service facility. Think again. The building has space for a concessionaire but when we asked who got the concession, we were told that Recreation and Park had interviewed 20 candidates, and no one wanted the job. That still leaves a 126-person-capacity meeting room that you can rent for $220 per hour on weekends. There's one little catch; reading the fine print on the city website you will find that "only limited tables and chairs are available - you will need to provide your own. " The city website doesn't say whether the $220-per-hour meter runs while you haul 126 chairs and needed tables in and out of the building. There are other consequences of the "two-headed monster" way of doing things. SFPUC many years ago delegated to Recreation and Park the responsibility for managing the lease agreement with the Will SFPUC Commissioners will get the message, and do what we suggested in 2011: Thank the Recreation and Park Department for its past efforts, and take back full management responsibility at Lake Merced?

 Should the proper model be pharmaceutical drugs or computer software? We're talking about fracking — otherwise known as hydraulic fracturing, tapping oil and gas by injecting large amounts of water and chemicals into the ground. It is praised as a job creator par excellence or reviled as having no peer in ability to pollute. And don't forget earthquakes. The immediate benefits are hard to miss, though. Stopping in Alice for lunch at a motel/buffet restaurant during a drive to McAllen recently, the large room was teeming with hungry guys obviously working this Texas boom. The motel/restaurant — whose name, unfortunately, I did not bother to record — was cashing in. And, no doubt, others are as well, or will. Back to that proper model. Pharmaceutical companies are required to put their drugs through extensive testing to make sure the cure isn't worse than the disease. Software companies trot out each new product with much hoo-ha, and then fix them with subsequent versions. Fracking has been around for a bit. It's the scale here and elsewhere that's worrisome. If problems crop up down the road, a “fix” will likely be promised. Fracking 6.2. Of course, software and pharmaceuticals are not the same, though fracking, like untested drugs, might also harbor at least potential for harm. In any case, it delays a weaning from fossil fuels that should be undertaken for other legitimate reasons. A peek in November of a preliminary study out of the <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel=opinion%2Fopinion_columnists%2Fo_ricardo_pimentel&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Mike+Mahoney%22">Mike Mahoney</a> But even he said that the amount of water fracking requires could be a problem if the duration of the drought makes it so, even as he noted that the drought has already spelled declining water levels just about everywhere. And did anyone else catch the word “preliminary” attached to that UT report? Mahoney is confident that Texas has the regulatory regimen to protect the water. I'm not, also harboring doubts about whether there has been enough study — whether usable groundwater is involved or not. Maybe it's just me, but introducing chemicals where they are not generally found does seem to fit the classical definition of polluting. Texas is now requiring companies to disclose those fracking chemicals. And the But we proceed as if all concerns have been answered. We've already defaulted to jobs mode — concluding that enough of these can shoo away potential harm. So maybe the pharmaceutical model does work for fracking after all. The following warning might be included. “Side effects may include contamination, earthquakes, illness and other symptoms that occur when leaping precedes looking. If symptoms persist longer than four millennia, consult your hydrologist.”  <em >o.ricardo.pimentel@express -news.net</em>

 Caption Close <strong>2007-01-11 04:00:00 PDT Moscow</strong> The breakthrough came after Russian President Belarus' imposition of the duty led Russia to switch off the flow of oil, a move greeted with dismay in Western Europe. Leaders there wondered aloud about Russia's reliability as an energy supplier. In Brussels on Wednesday, EU officials announced a long-term energy plan to reduce the continent's dependence on oil and gas and limit the greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. "Europe must lead the world into a new ... post-industrial revolution, the development of a low-carbon economy," said The plan, which will be discussed by the EU's 27 member states in February, calls for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut by at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. That goes beyond the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which called for the EU overall to cut to 8 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. The United States has refused to sign the accord, arguing that it would damage the U.S. economy and should require developing countries such as China and India to meet similar goals. "We are not speaking about European warming -- we are speaking about global warming," Barroso said. "We need the United States with us -- they are, after all, the biggest polluter in the world." It is uncertain whether the EU plan will be accepted by member governments and, if so, whether the targets can be met. A number of European countries, including Italy and Spain, are having trouble meeting the Kyoto requirements. Environmentalists would like to see even more ambitious goals for reducing emissions. The plan emphasizes the development of renewable energy, such as biofuels, and new low-pollution technologies, as well as the reduction of emissions from existing energy sources. Belarus, which is heavily dependent on Russian energy subsidies, has been smarting from increases in the prices it pays for Russian natural gas and the crude oil that it profitably reprocessed before selling it to Western Europe. It imposed the duties on Russian oil transshipments in response; Russia asserts Belarus was also siphoning off oil for its own use. Belarusian Prime Minister Russia had insisted earlier that lifting the oil duty, which it said was illegal, was a nonnegotiable precondition for any talks. It was unclear whether Putin promised Belarus anything in return. The Kremlin issued a terse statement saying that Putin and Lukashenko had discussed "energy relations," among other issues.

 How much harm to the environment and to human health could -- or will -- the U.S.-led attack on Iraq cause? " In the 1991 Gulf War, the magazine noted, "Saddam's retreating forces sabotaged more than 600 Kuwaiti oil wells, which burned for up to nine months. " Their fumes led to acid rain and turned Kuwait City dark by day. Oil spilled into the Persian Gulf, damaging prawn fisheries for years; oil dumped into Kuwait's deserts formed lakes that seeped into and polluted underwater aquifers. ( This time, "war in Iraq could spell the end for the Mesopotamian marshes on the lower reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, once Iraq's most prized environmental asset," and thousands of migrating water birds could be hurt. Meanwhile, heavy machinery and vehicles rolling through the desert could break up its crusty surface, a brittle layer that helps prevent erosion.

"Official medicine believes there is no connection between these diseases and uranium pollution," the Russian scientist explained, "but scientific arguments proving the connection are steadily increasing." As mainstream American media have become increasingly homogeneous in tone and content, a growing U.S. audience has been "seeking an alternative" to their same-sounding fare, according to "Faced with the jingoism of the cable news stations CNN and Fox, rabid right-wing views on talk radio and the hesitancy of the liberal print media to criticize the government," the newspaper said, " Hits to the Similarly, "A glance at U.S. television makes it obvious why people are seeking an alternative," As quoted in the "As a journalist, I find it quite strange that there's not more criticism of the Bush administration in the American media," Dennis said.

 Children living in pre-1950, poorly maintained housing - often the norm in low-income neighborhoods - bear the greatest risk of lead poisoning. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has estimated that 80 percent of West Coast houses built before 1978 contain lead-based paint. Homes built before 1950 have a higher risk because those paints contained substantially more lead. Dust, both the kind created as paint deteriorates over the years and the kind generated by renovation or paint preparation work, is the most common source of lead poisoning. This lead-contaminated dust can settle on the floor or soil where children play or on toys and other objects toddlers tend to put in their mouth or touch prior to eating. Children also have been poisoned by the dust brought home on their parent's construction work clothes and shoes. The problem is widespread; a federal National Health and Nutrition Examination survey released in 1994 found that 8.9 percent of all children have elevated blood lead levels. The California Department of Health Services estimates that 254,000 children in California are affected by lead poisoning. Children ages nine months to five years and pregnant women are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can cause permanent learning disabilities, kidney damage and hearing loss. It can cause all sorts of medical problems in adults, too, including decreased sex drive, headache, irritability and a host of other symptoms.&lt;

 <strong>1995-12-15 04:00:00 PDT MILL VALLEY</strong> Excitement at Frantoio during its first pressing season is running high. People from all over Northern California are bringing in olives they never bothered to harvest before - manzanillo, sevillano, picholine, mission - to see what kind of oil they will make. First the crates of olives are poured into a machine that washes them in water and shakes away the leaves. Then the olives are slowly fed into the grinder, two massive granite wheels that crush olives and pits into a rough paste. This paste is evenly spread by hand onto round mats and stacked on a spindle between steel plates. A water-driven hydraulic press gently squeezes out the oil and the water. You can see the liquid sensuously dripping off the sides and being channeled into a centrifuge, which sends the pure oil into one bucket and the olive water into another. This is the moment to ask if you can have a taste from that golden stream of oil. If the owner of the olives being pressed gives the nod, you will be able to experience something unique: a food that radiates raw energy, that tastes alive on your tongue. Smell the brand new oil and then sip it from a spoon, noisily drawing the oil through your teeth with air the way the experts do. A melange of sensations will hit your mouth, starting with the fruitiness of the olives, then the subtle smell, perhaps of almonds or apples, then the buttery, unctuous texture, and finally a hot and peppery jolt. Dip one of the Italian breads on the table into the oil for a more integrated perspective. Compare this just-extracted oil to slightly older oils. Frantoio sets its tables with cruets of its own new press olive oil, currently an excellent oil from sevillano olives. The sevillano probably will taste very different from the oil just coming from the press. You'll learn firsthand that each oil has its own character, which, like wine, is due to geography, soil differences, the age and variety of the trees, and the blend of olives that go into the press. By the end of your meal, you will have experienced something afforded very few Americans, a taste of traditionally extracted, cold pressed, locally grown, extra virgin olive oil. When I first heard about Frantoio I thought the olive oil press was a design gimmick, albeit a very lavish one. But Frantoio's owners are serious about both their mill and their restaurant. I saw crates of moldy olives rejected by the workers at the frantoio (the Italian world for an olive mill), because they didn't want their equipment contaminated by bad fruit. In fact, one of Frantoio's owners, His two partners, Umberto Gibin from Il Fornaio and chef Giovanni Perticone from Emporio Armani and Scala's Bistro, are no less serious about their end of the business. They have put together a crowd-pleasing Italian menu, strong on pasta dishes and antipasti, and a first-rate Italian wine list, while keeping prices refreshingly moderate, especially given the handsome modern dining room and a professional level of service. Over several visits, in between slurping olive oil, I have enjoyed satisfying salads: Amara ($6.50), Italian lettuces, roasted vegetables and triangles of grilled, salty, sheeps milk cheese called ricotta salata, an aged version of the familiar ricotta; a fine Cesare ($5.25) with whole leaves of romaine and wide shavings of Parmesan; and Carciofi ($6.25), a salad of pickled baby artichokes with lots of the good lettuces Frantoio's kitchen uses. Mussels steamed open in the wood-fired pizza oven are a treat now ($6.95) when ocean waters are cold. Frantoio's presentation of them on a mound of saffron mashed potatoes surrounded by a fresh tomato sauce works better as a main course than an antipasto. The plate is so substantial - and delicious - that it ends up being a whole meal by itself. Carpaccio of bland raw beef ($6.75) and over-lemoned raw venison ($7.25) are undistinctive, and I wasn't wild about some soft crusted pizzas even though they were baked in an oak-fired oven. But I did love a flat-bread pizza called Feroncella ($4.75) adapted from a recipe recorded by 16th century Umbrian monks. A crisp, unleavened crust was slathered with cabbage and onions cooked in olive oil, of course, and topped with pecorino cheese. The flavor of the olive oil played a role in the success of the dish. The pastas are the real strength here, especially the ones on the regular menu. Ear-shaped pasta, orecchiette, with Italian broccoli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil ($9.50) has become a Bay Area favorite and the Frantoio kitchen does an expert job on it. Linguine with small Manila clams and oven-roasted tomatoes ($11.50) boasts the same magical, very Italian treatment as the orecchiette. The pasta is just coated with pungent olive oil, tomatoes and clam juice, neither wet nor dry. A pile of saffron tinted fettuccine is cooked in a parchment with shrimp, scallops and tomatoes ($12.50) so that the tender noodles absorb all the flavors. Sedani ($8.95), tube shaped pasta, come in a deep bowl with sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese, a hearty, winning combination. The kitchen also makes its own stuffed pastas. Ravioli filled with bright green spinach and ricotta, drizzled with browned butter and sage ($11.95) were toothsome and homey one day. On another, pumpkin tortelli ($11.95) were over-sweetened, strewn with chopped nuts, and tasted like dessert. If you're in the mood for a butter-tender, flavor-packed veal shank on saffron risotto with all sorts of vegetables, head over here for ossobuco ($14.95), one of the best anywhere. My hat goes off to Umberto Gibin for putting together one of the finest Italian wine lists around, though he had lots of experience doing the same thing for Il Fornaio. Try the Rosso di Montefalco, Arnaldo Carpai, 1991 ($22), an Umbrian red wine with unusual character; or a half bottle of the delicious, classy Barolo from Michele Chiarlo, 1991 ($18). What a pleasure to be able to drink an affordable half bottle of luxurious wine! For dessert, a coffee granita parfait ($4.25) hits the spot with alternating layers of sweet, strong, espresso ice crystals and sweetened whipped cream. Or, if you just want pure coffee, the creamy topped espresso is perfect. I hope that by next season, Frantoio will come up with more dishes that feature olive oil as the catalytic ingredient - perhaps a tasting plate of different new oils with raw vegetables; or a peasanty soup of beans and pasta "anointed" with a pour of new oil. But maybe I'm just thinking of the ways I'm going to use the bottles of new oil that I bought at Frantoio in my own kitchen.

The most profligate disseminator of the poisons in the Bay Area was the ConocoPhillips refinery in Rodeo, which released 896,733 pounds into the environment in 2011, the report said. Valero Refining in Benicia released 504,472 pounds, the second most in the Bay Area, the numbers show. "It doesn't necessarily mean that we are breathing these chemicals or that these facilities are violating any laws, but it is a starting point for members of the public to begin asking questions," said The toxics report tracks chemicals, including copper, petroleum, nitrates, lead, asbestos and ammonia, manufactured, transported or released into the environment by refineries, mines, electrical plants and waste disposal sites across the nation. Alaska was the top releaser of toxic substances, offloading more than 1 billion pounds of chemicals, 26 percent of the United States total. Vermont had the least, with 366,815 pounds. California ranked 26th out of the 50 states in the nation. California businesses released about 3 million more pounds of toxic substances into the environment than were released in 2010. The report showed that air pollutants decreased 13 percent and underground injections of toxic chemicals decreased 67 percent. Still, toxic emissions into the water and on land increased by 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively, compared with 2010, and the transfer of toxic substances to off-site areas increased 72 percent.

She said the amount of poisonous material reported from year to year can also be influenced by new clean-fuel regulations, pollution-prevention measures, the amount of economic activity and innovations in chemical processes. The self-reporting regulations are monitored by two inspectors, who cover the entire EPA region, which also includes Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. "The story really varies, depending on the particular facility," Lee said. "Sometimes facilities have changed their methods of testing, which changes the results of their reporting."

 Caption Close SHASTA LAKE — Secrets are lurking hundreds of feet beneath the murky emerald surface of Shasta Lake. Legends of giant sturgeon and catfish persist, and an American Indian tribe’s ancestral village still rests at the lake’s bottom. But there is another secret that lies in sediment of the lake bed: mercury. Dammed in 1944, Shasta provides water from Sacramento to the crop-irrigating breadbasket of the San Joaquin Valley more than 300 miles south. It is California’s largest reservoir and a treasured jewel for anglers, many unaware of the poison in the lake and in the fish they catch. Mercury, a legacy of the Gold Rush, has worked its way into Shasta’s food chain, state tests have found, revealing levels beyond what is considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency. But no advisory to people who fish the lake has been put in place. While sparsely populated — Shasta County has about 180,000 residents — the lake draws 1.4 million visitors a year and is one of the state’s top fishing destinations. “To me it seems like clean, good water,” said “I never got sick,” said Even if Thomas had glanced through the <strong>Tests to be re-evaluated </strong> Change may come this summer when officials at the If change does come, two things could happen: an advisory would be listed in the booklet given to all anglers who obtain a California freshwater fishing license, and the Runoff from sites once active with gold mining is the main cause for the presence of mercury in the lake. Gold mining requires mercury, and there are many shuttered mines around the lake. But the widespread practice of placer mining, or gold panning, is most to blame for leftover mercury in streams that feed into Shasta, said During the Gold Rush, while countless miners chopped down trees to make sluices and cabins, an estimated 7,600 tons of mercury were dumped into California’s once-clear waters. Thompson said that every placer miner had a bottle of mercury to separate the gold from rock, and its unregulated use also polluted the Shasta watershed with a large amount of it. “If people knew how much mercury was in the creeks up here they would be surprised,” he said. <strong>Recent mercury deposits</strong> The lake is also coping with more recent mercury intrusion. Upstream volcanic geothermal springs along with atmospheric industrial pollution that crosses the Pacific Ocean from Asia both deposit mercury into the lake, said Philip Woodward, an engineering hydrologist at the “That’s an area that could bear some research, but it would be some meticulous work,” Woodward said. Methylmercury poisoning causes central nervous system damage, and many of its symptoms are similar to those seen in cerebral palsy. In aquatic systems it moves from bacteria to plankton to fish, and at each step in the food chain it compounds, typically with older and larger predatory fish having the highest concentrations. The There are no recorded cases of methylmercury poisoning from Shasta Lake because local government does not collect data on it, said “We’ve never been given the green light to advise against eating the fish in Shasta Lake specifically,” she said. “But they might be keeping a tight lid on that one because that’s a big political issue I’m sure. Recreation is a huge industry for us up here, and they probably don’t want to scare people away. We have throngs of fishermen coming up here.” Shasta County Board of Supervisors Chair Leonard Moty, who said he was not aware of any of the mercury issues affecting the lake, said tourism to Shasta contributes to the roughly $2 million per year in sales tax revenue for the county, but that this is just a fraction of the $16 million generated by property tax. “I would have no inclination to hide something like that from the public, even if it meant (losing) tourism dollars,” he said. “It is what it is, and if that is an issue we have to deal with, then we’ll just have to do it.” <strong>No warning signs</strong> Because there are no warning signs around the lake, anyone seeking to investigate mercury in the water would have to do some sleuthing around the Environmental Protection Agency and State Water Resources Control Board websites to detect there is an environmental problem. One could follow the “Water Quality Assessment” link to an interactive map showing all impaired water bodies across California. In 2008, the EPA listed Shasta as impaired by mercury based on a scientific calculation called “maximum total daily loads,” which means the amount of a pollutant a body of water can receive and still safely meet quality standards. But this designation does not include mercury levels in fish and is simply not strong enough for people such as Chief <strong>Lurking problem</strong> “You have this monster festering underneath that we know is there,” she said. “You’ve got a problem here because they’ve already studied the fish, and the fish in Shasta Lake have mercury poisoning. But they are not posting that. We said, ‘In how many languages will you post that the fish in Shasta Lake have mercury poisoning?’ ... That was like eight years ago.” The Bureau of Reclamation is not opposed to erecting warning signs for fishermen around the lake, said “We are going along with that and waiting for that process,” Mosley said. “If they came up with some things like that, we would most certainly do our best to comply.” The decision to issue health warnings for Shasta’s fish is up to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment. To develop the advisories, the agency will use fish data, much of which has been collected or funded by the state water board. It will then make the information available online to the public and in the California Fish and Wildlife Sportfishing Regulations booklet, which displays all site-specific fishing advisories throughout the state. The advisories include information about the fish that can be eaten without harm or should be avoided altogether. There are  77 site-specific advisories throughout the state, but none at Shasta. The re-evaluation of state tests will likely begin in July and could take up to three years, Brodberg said. He said a lack of comprehensive fish species testing is what has held back an advisory. <strong>High levels in bass, catfish</strong> The 2007 study of mercury contamination in Shasta Lake found that both spotted bass and catfish larger than 14 inches exceeded safe state and federal methylmercury levels, with the highest concentrations found in the catfish. But the findings were never made public in the California Fish and Wildlife Sport Fishing booklet. “I thought they put Shasta Lake in there but I guess not,” said Monty Currier, environmental scientist in charge of reservoir sport fish at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. “I thought they were going to add that in the book for sure.” A great variability exists in mercury levels for different fish species, and based on certain norms, the state’s health hazard assessment agency emphasizes eating rainbow trout. Bass, catfish and brown trout are typically the fish most prone to high levels of mercury because of their predatory nature. EPA methlymercury limits for safe eating are 0.3 milligram per kilogram. Data from the 2007 state tests reveal bass with levels just under 0.5 milligram per kilogram and catfish at more than double the limit. On the other hand, testing of rainbow trout from 2002 and 2006 shows safe levels between 0.1 and 0.2 milligram per kilogram. Brown trout, a commonly eaten predatory fish typically higher in mercury than rainbow trout, could prove to be the deciding species if the lake’s fish are to be listed as contaminated. <strong >Fish tests </strong> “That’s why we need more testing,” Brodberg said. “We don’t like to issue an advisory for one fish. We like to have at least three species of fish and nine samples of each of them.” If the data are sufficient, Shasta will be added to the advisory section of the California Fish and Wildlife Sport Fishing booklet, said Margy Gassel, a research scientist with the state’s health hazard office. But in terms of posting signs, that is out of the organization’s hands, and would be up to the Bureau of Reclamation. For now, fishermen will be left guessing as to the safety of their catch. In his two decades of fishing Shasta Lake, Sage Baker said he has heard about the mercury issue in conversation but has never seen any proof. “It’s kind of crazy that you don’t hear more about this mercury stuff. It seems it could damage your health,” he said. “I just assumed that if it was that bad, I would have heard more about it.” <em> </em > <em> Ted Andersen is a freelance writer.</em> <em> </em >

 Two environmental groups sued the The chemical chlorpyrifos was banned for household use nine years ago by the The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in New York, is the next step after a petition was filed in 2007 for the plaintiffs, the "It's been three years, and they haven't given an answer one way or another," said "In its class, this pesticide is the worst of the worst," he said. "Its effects can range from headaches to neurological disorders, and in theory it could cause death." Regan noted that a number of other countries have already outlawed use of chlorpyrifos, including South Africa in May. Farmers and others who use the pesticide, however, say there are no good alternatives and that chlorpyrifos can be used safely. The suit, filed in federal court in New York, seeks to compel the EPA to make a decision. The chemical is used for various reasons in all nine Bay Area counties, according to the state However, it is most widely used in the Central Valley and is polluting 29 of the state's waterways, mostly in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, according to state records. It can cling to crops that have been sprayed, Regan said, but is also capable of vaporizing or settling onto dust particles and being carried through the air. Regan cited the experience of a 24-year-old Lindsay (Tulare County) resident, The suit contends that the EPA has had plenty of time to make a decision on the issue; Regan noted that their public comment period on the matter expired in December 2007. Farmers, however, oppose the all-out banning of the chemical, said Use of chlorpyrifos by California farmers, she said, has declined by more than half in recent years. "We have to continually evaluate chemicals and make sure they are used in the safest way - but I do believe that has been done with this chemical," she said. "It's a widely used chemical in California and across the United States, and it's used on a wide range of insects. There's no alternative that's going to replace it tomorrow, but we try to continue to reduce its use."

 Polluted drinking water in some of California's most productive agricultural areas is putting hundreds of thousands of people at risk for disease and cancer, according to a study released Tuesday by UC Davis. The report, commissioned by the The problem is likely to worsen over the next few decades as excess nitrogen applied to crops continues to slowly percolate through the soil into the groundwater, the study said. "This is a safe drinking water issue," said The report, "Addressing Nitrate in California's Drinking Water," is the most comprehensive scientific investigation of nitrate contamination ever done in the area, which includes Fresno and Bakersfield and extends all the way to the edge of The report found that 254,000 people living in the area rely on groundwater that may exceed the nitrate standard of 45 milligrams per liter set by the The findings are disturbing, not only because nitrates in groundwater have been linked to cancer, thyroid and reproductive problems, especially in infants, but because there is no easy solution. Harter said it would cost between $20 million and $35 million every year for decades to treat drinking water and fix systems. The costs could increase over time as more nitrates work their way into the water table. "This is a very serious matter," said Merkley said nitrate applications to crops have leveled off since the late 1980s and early 1990s, while crop yields have increased dramatically, meaning farmers are producing more with less. The problem, according to the report, is that synthetic fertilizer, increased manure applications and a shift from pasture-raised to confined dairy cattle has increased the overall nitrate load. Besides contaminating groundwater, human-produced nitrogen and nitrates have also been blamed for causing marine "dead zones" and contributing to climate change. "Growers need to buck up and face the reality that their pollution is harming the environment and jeopardizing the health of tens of thousands of residents," said "I think there will be a push for new regulations and legislation," Merkley said. "Unfortunately, that seems to be everyone's response to this, but over the last 20 years we have shown that we are able to address these issues ourselves without a regulatory hammer." The study, which was mandated by legislation passed in 2008, concluded that it would not be feasible to remove nitrates from groundwater basins. Instead, it recommends taking measures to improve fertilizer management and treatment systems. -- The UC Davis nitrate report can be found at Peter Fimrite is a

 Pacific Gas & Electric Co. will pay $3.6 million in penalties for allowing a toxic plume of chemically laced groundwater to expand underneath homes and farms in the Mojave Desert town of Hinkley, according to a settlement announced Thursday. The San Francisco utility agreed to pay the money after it violated a 2008 order by the It is the latest trouble for PG&E, which was blamed for allowing chromium 6 to leak from the cooling towers at a compressor station between 1952 and 1966, poisoning the San Bernardino County town's drinking water.

 Caption Close Years ago, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. promised to clean up the groundwater beneath Hinkley, a small Mojave Desert town crossed by one of the company's natural gas pipelines. A toxic form of chromium used by PG&E had seeped into the water, in a place where every home needs a well. Helped by a little-known law clerk named But 17 years later, the chromium remains. And despite PG&E's efforts, the plume of tainted water appears to be spreading, with the chemical showing up in more wells than before. Now, Hinkley residents who weren't part of the original court case have filed a new lawsuit against the company, saying PG&E has rendered their homes virtually worthless. "These guys are in the middle of the desert, and they're wholly dependent on well water - there's no option," said Hinkley is, in fact, emptying out. PG&E has been buying and bulldozing homes from residents who have decided to flee - 130 properties so far. The town, about 15 miles northwest of Barstow in San Bernardino County, recently lost its only school. Exact population figures aren't available because the town is unincorporated, but some longtime residents say the population has dropped substantially to 3,000 or fewer. Roberta Walker, 59, helped craft the original lawsuit, doing her own research that she passed on to Brockovich, played by actress Now Walker and her husband are negotiating with PG&E to sell their home. "It's inevitable," said Walker, who is not part of the new suit. "We can't stay here. It's a ghost town." The new class-action suit, filed July 19 in San Bernardino County, covers Hinkley residents who did not participate in the first lawsuit - people who thought their homes and wells were miles away from the chromium plume. More than 100 property owners could eventually join, said van Oordt, with the The chemical - hexavalent chromium, or chromium-6 - started leaching into Hinkley's water decades ago. The town lies along the route of a pipeline bringing natural gas from Texas to the Bay Area. PG&E built a compressor station for the pipeline in 1952 and for the next 14 years used hexavalent chromium in the station's cooling system, adding the substance to water as a way to fight corrosion in the machinery. The chromium-laced water was then dumped in unlined ponds nearby. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed classifying chromium-6 as likely to cause cancer when ingested. The EPA already considers it a carcinogen when inhaled. Since settling the original lawsuit, PG&E has tried to pen in the plume of tainted groundwater while testing ways to clean up the chromium. One method involves injecting small amounts of food-grade ethanol - similar to hard liquor - into the aquifer. Bacteria feed off the ethanol and multiply. And those bacteria convert chromium-6 into chromium-3, a nontoxic form of the metal. "The thing we like about that is, it gets to the problem down where it is," said The company also pumps the tainted water onto alfalfa fields, where bacteria in the soil convert the chemical into chromium-3. Sullivan said that the most-polluted wells, those near the compressor station, have shown a steep drop in chromium-6 concentrations, with levels falling more than 50 percent. "We're making good progress on this plume," said Sullivan, who has spent seven years trying to clean Hinkley's water. "We're knocking out the core." And yet, the plume may be moving. Chromium-6 has been detected in wells several miles from the original plume. To PG&E, this is a sign of better testing - not spreading contamination. More wells are now being checked, and the hexavalent chromium within them may be naturally occurring, according to the company. The government agency overseeing the cleanup, the "At least in some areas, we believe it's spread," she said. Fully cleaning up the aquifer could take as long as 30 to 60 years, according to PG&E. In the meantime, the company is buying water for some homeowners and has installed water purifying systems for others. And for people within a mile of the expanded plume - as defined by the water board - the company will discuss buying their property, with PG&E basing its offers on home values in nearby towns such as Apple Valley. But in some cases, PG&E's offers, which are not part of the original lawsuit settlement, represent a substantial loss to the homeowners. "I told them it was ridiculous," said Ray, an elementary school teacher in Barstow who is not part of the new suit. Although she still loves Hinkley's open landscape and the quiet of a small town, she doesn't want to stay and wait for PG&E to finish its cleanup. Five of her neighbors have already moved, and a sixth will soon. "I'm 53," Ray said. "I may still be alive in 40 years, but I don't want to be here." <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel =science&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22David+R.+Baker%22">David R.

San Mateo County bayside beaches had some of the poorest water quality in California last year, according to a report by an environmental group released Wednesday. Parkside Aquatic Park, Lakeshore Park and Coyote Point - all in the city of San Mateo - were among the worst offenders. In all, 16 percent of water samples from San Mateo County beaches exceeded state health standards for pollutants last year, up from 10 percent last year, according to "Testing the Waters," a national study by the Another recently reported study by the organization Heal the Bay took a more positive tone by focusing on the fact that Bay Area beaches outside the problem spots showed low pollution levels. "The problems we see are just not going away," said The report looked at pathogen levels at more than 3,500 beaches in 30 coastal and Great Lakes states. Nationwide, water quality improved from last year, with beach closures and advisories down 14 percent, but pathogens remained high. U.S. beaches saw more than 20,000 closures or warning advisories - which are triggered when water quality samples show pathogen levels that exceed the state standards - for 11 of the past 12 years, according to the group, which has conducted the study for 23 years. High bacteria levels are generally caused by sewage overflows and storm runoff, in which polluted water flows down creeks or culverts to the ocean or bay. Swimmers exposed to raw sewage can suffer pinkeye, gastrointestinal problems and skin rashes. In California, where beaches are a major tourist draw, closures can have a devastating impact on local economies, according to the report. A one-day closure at Huntington Beach in Orange County, for example, would cost about $100,000 in lost revenue to local businesses. In San Mateo County, most of the offending beaches are relatively enclosed and prone to stagnant water. Nearly all of them are on the bay side and adjoin a heavily urban area, but a few oceanside beaches also had high numbers of closures, including portions of Pillar Point and Venice beaches in Half Moon Bay, and San Mateo County beaches saw 953 one-day closures and 413 advisories in 2012. Bolinas Beach in Marin, by comparison, had none San Mateo's high number of closures and advisories is largely due to the high number of water samples, said The county has more miles of accessible shoreline than most other counties and voluntarily samples its water quality year-round, exceeding the state requirements, Peterson said. Crown Beach in Alameda, another bayside beach next to an urban area, saw weekly samples taken at six locations. The worst location was Crab Cove, where 16 percent of the year's samples exceeded state standards and led to 54 closures or advisories. The best spots at Crown Beach were at Windsurfer Corner, Sunset Road and the In San Francisco, Windsurfer Circle at Candlestick Point was among the worst in the Bay Area, with 49 closures or advisories and 49 percent of the water samples exceeding state standards. To help improve beach water quality, the Natural Resources Defense Council recommends that the The group encourages individuals to clean up pet waste, fix home rain gutters to drain into the ground instead of onto concrete, refrain from over-watering gardens and pressure public officials to strengthen pollution laws.  <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel =science&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Carolyn+Jones%22">Carolyn Jones</a>

 Caption Close RICHMOND BEACH -- A mistake during a fuel transfer spilled about 4,800 gallons of oil into Puget Sound yesterday, creating an iridescent brown sheen that drifted from Shoreline to Ballard to north Bainbridge Island. While small by historical standards, the spill was one of the largest in the past few years, according to Coast Guard records. It occurred early in the morning at the The cause of the spill is under investigation. Crews placed protective booms -- big plastic curtains that hang in the water -- to block the oil from sensitive areas such as Pipers and Boeing creeks. But state officials said it could take weeks or months to gauge the environmental impact. Central Puget Sound, where the spill spread, contains eelgrass beds, salt marshes, Dungeness crabs, clams, birds, seals and spawning beaches for baitfish such as herring. Crews rescued one heavily oiled gull whose wings were stuck to its body; it was being rewarmed and cared for yesterday. A harbor seal pup found covered in oil died yesterday afternoon, although biologists are unsure precisely what killed it. Scattered pockets of pollution reached beaches south of Edmonds to Carkeek Park and along Jefferson Head in Kitsap County, where crews shoveled up oily sand and used absorbent pads to soak up the escaped fuel. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= seattlenews&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22John+Schnaidt%22">John Schnaidt</a> "Apparently someone wasn't minding the store," he said. Officials could not say when the spill would be contained, but they expect to be cleaning up for days. They estimated that about 670 gallons of oily water had been recovered from the 18 boats working to remove fuel from the surface. "Whatever resources are necessary, we're going to do it," said The cleanup is being led by the Environmentalists have been pressing the state for years to require routine deployment of booms that would capture spilled oil whenever petroleum products are being transferred over or near the water. "Even with a responsible company like Foss, stuff happens," said There is a growing trend to transport fuel by barge, Felleman said. Heavy fuel like the stuff spilled yesterday is too thick for pipelines. The barges are under less regulatory scrutiny and have smaller crews than tankers, he said, making them a threat to the marine environment. After touring the spill scene yesterday, state Rep. "If that barge had been boomed, we would have had a few thousand gallons contained right there at Point Wells," Cooper said. Yesterday's spill was modest by historical standards. In 1985, about 239,000 gallons of crude oil spilled near Port Angeles when the Arco Anchorage ran aground, and in 1991 about 600,000 gallons of oil spilled at U.S. Oil and Refining in Tacoma. But since improvements ordered in the oil transport industry after the Exxon Valdez unleashed 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989, spills have been greatly reduced. Coast Guard records for thousands of Puget Sound spills from 1999 through September 2002 showed there were fewer than a dozen spills that exceeded 1,000 gallons. A spill of an asphalt-based oil at the same That 4,000-gallon spill occurred when an overfilled storage tank burst. Chevron workers pumping fuel from a tanker ship failed to switch the flow to an empty tank once another had filled. The spill triggered the closure of many public beaches and workers labored for more than a week cleaning the beaches and filling hundreds of plastic garbage bags with seaweed gummy with oil. This time, though, officials are hopeful the damage to the shoreline will be less dramatic.

 The wastes stored in underground tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation are so dangerous that their fumes give people headaches, nosebleeds and sore throats and make them nauseated. An unfortunate few have been doused with the deadly stuff in accidents; one now is dying of cancer. Called by state regulators "the most toxic waste known to this environment," the 53 million gallons of waste sit in 177 massive, buried tanks near the Columbia River. Intended for short-term use, some of the tanks are more than a half-century old. They were built of carbon steel -- an alloy prone to corrosion. They are cocooned in concrete that in places has cracked and crumbled. The contents historically boiled and exploded, and the tank bottoms buckled. More than one-third leaked. The tanks are supposed to be emptied and the waste safely trapped in glass, but those plans keep getting pushed back. At the current rate of funding, tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation won't be emptied for decades -- maybe even a century. Those delays are raising a question no one dared ask a few years ago: Is it time to build new tanks? It's a proposition that has been avoided for fear that it would cost too much and give the But most of the existing tanks should have been decommissioned years ago. The older ones are 30 to 50 years past their intended lifetime. Even the newer tanks -- the last ones were built in 1986 -- likely will be years past their life span before they're taken out of use. "These things are falling apart in the ground while we speak," said Some of the risks are catastrophic -- tanks so rotted that they collapse under the weight of pumps and other gear used to remove the waste, or shake apart in an earthquake. "We have reminded (the Energy Department) that a collapsed tank out there would just be a devastating issue," said A much more likely threat is continued leaking, or leaking triggered when the tank contents are blasted with liquids to loosen up solid chunks so they can be pumped out. Already about 1.2 million gallons of waste have leaked from the tanks. The waste hasn't reached the Columbia River, but it has seeped into pools of groundwater deep beneath the tanks. There is a lot of uncertainty as to when the polluted groundwater will reach the river -- estimates range from 30 to 200 years. Liquid waste was moved in recent years from the 149 older, single-shell tanks to the 28 newer, double-shell tanks. The single shells now hold about 30 million gallons of sludge and chunky salt cakes, and about 3 million gallons of liquid that couldn't be extracted. The risk of leaks was significantly reduced -- but not eliminated. "We could not tell you that there are no leaks happening today based on the monitoring they have," said The strategy for dealing with the tanks is to transfer all of the waste -- not just the liquids -- from the single-shell to the double-shell tanks. Then that waste is treated in enormous plants where it is "vitrified," or turned to glass. The glass would then be stored for thousands of years. Over the past two decades, plans for the vitrification plant have repeatedly been scrapped and reworked. The cost of building the plant has nearly tripled in recent years to $12.2 billion. Administrators say that it should be running by 2019 -- an eight-year delay from earlier estimates. At risk is the Columbia River, home to salmon and other fish that play a key role in the diet and customs of the Yakama Indians. A study by the Environmental Protection Agency found that fish caught near Hanford had the highest concentrations of PCBs, metals, dioxins and other contaminants in the Columbia River Basin. It concluded that tribal people who ate fish from the Hanford Reach had up to a 1 in 50 lifetime risk of contracting fatal cancers. "We do have a very big concern as to what is in the system, what is in the river, what is in the sediment, where does it come from?" said Jim, the Yakama environmental manager. Those questions are unanswered, and the tribe doesn't fish that stretch of river. To protect the Columbia, Ecology officials said they would consider building new tanks, though they worry that it would take money and attention away from other aspects of cleanup. It could cost about $150 million and take up to a decade to build just one tank. And while no one likes the risk posed by the tanks, it does provide an urgency to act. Energy Department officials said new tanks are not an option. "We don't recommend, and we aren't discussing, building new double-shell tanks," said The department believes that current engineering data show that the tanks "structurally are sound and not in danger of any near-term collapse or failures," Noyes said. For now, work emptying the single-shell tanks is stopped until at least next month because of a spill last summer of 85 gallons of radioactive waste during its removal. The accident was reviewed by Energy investigators, who made numerous recommendations for improving safety, planning and spill response, and those fixes are being implemented. Besides, there's room in the double-shell tanks for just 2 million gallons more of waste, Noyes said. Evaporation can create a little more space. Engineers and structural workers recently gave the green light to safely fill some of the double-shell tanks to higher levels than previously allowed. But it's only a short-term fix. "It's untenable, unsupportable to have these wastes ... sitting in tanks some unknown, indefinite period of time," said "We're dealing with a problem," he said, "where the contents of those tanks could conceivably and irreversibly harm a major river system in the United States."

 By Tina Lam Detroit Free Press (MCT) Oct. 13--Six highly polluted areas in Michigan, including the St. Clair River, will get a big push from the EPA to finish long-term cleanups over the next two years, said Lisa Jackson, administrator of the agency, as she attended a Great Lakes conference Wednesday at Wayne State University. Michigan has 13 sites that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designates as Areas of Concern on the U.S. side of the Great Lakes. There are 30 total, and Michigan has the most of the eight states in the region. All of Michigan's sites have histories of extreme industrial and other pollution that has yet to be cleaned up -- primarily PCBs discharged for decades by industries along the shores of the lakes and rivers. PCBs are cancer-causing chemicals that can affect wildlife and humans. Mercury, heavy metals and sewage overflows also contaminate the sites. The reason the agency chose the six Michigan sites and three others in the region for extra money and attention is because they're already close to being completed, Jackson said. Seven sites were left off the fast-track list: Detroit, Clinton, Kalamazoo and Rouge rivers, Saginaw River and Bay, and Torch and Muskegon lakes in the Upper Peninsula. "We tried to find places where we could hit a milestone and make that commitment to it," she said. Finishing the work means the areas can be removed from the list of troubled areas and used for tourism and development. They'll be much cleaner, if not completely pollution-free. At the conference, Jackson also said the White House was standing firm on a new rule to limit mercury emissions from coal-fired plants. The EPA has been under attack in Congress and by some attorneys general, including Michigan's Bill Schuette, over the new rule, which utilities and some elected officials say will kill jobs. Jackson also said the agency will work to reduce algae in the Maumee and Saginaw Bay watersheds. The money for the cleanup projects comes from President Barack Obama's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a five-year commitment to clean up. Congress approved more than $775 million for the first two years; this is the start of the third year of the initiative. Contact Tina Lam: 313-222-6421 or tlam@freepress.com

 <strong> By Keith Matheny</strong> <em >Detroit Free Press</em> (MCT) — This weekend’s toxic algae bloom on western Lake Erie that disrupted water supplies for more than 400,000 in southeast Michigan and the Toledo, Ohio, area should stir action, experts said. “This is worse than the Cuyahoga River burning,” said Carol Stepien, director of the University of Toledo’s Lake Erie Center. She referred to a notorious incident in 1969 on the city of Cleveland’s main river that gained national attention and prompted cleaning up the highly polluted tributary. The toxic algae bloom “should be the final wake-up call for environmental action that’s embraced by people,” Stepien said. And though the city of Toledo has lifted its ban on water usage, the crisis may not be over, said Don Scavia, an aquatic ecologist and director of the University of Michigan’s Graham Sustainability Institute. “Typically these blooms reach maximum size in late August or early September,” he said. “We may be looking at the beginning of the season, as it continues to grow.” There are several types of algae that occur on Lake Erie. But the one that produces microcystin toxin is prevalent, and most concerning because it can damage the liver and kidneys. Unlike many other types of water contamination, boiling microcystin-tainted water does not improve — and may worsen — the toxic levels. Algae blooms have occurred on Lake Erie each summer in recent years. Last weekend’s crisis was the product of a number of different dynamics coming together, Scavia said: In February, the International Joint Commission, a U.S.-Canadian agency that works to resolve Great Lakes water issues, issued a list of recommendations to reduce the phosphorus loads reaching western Lake Erie — with a particular focus on agricultural practices, such as farm runoff that is the chief source of the nutrients. Recommendations include avoiding phosphorus applications in the fall; and banning the spreading of manure and other biosolids on frozen or snow-covered ground. Other recommendations include regular inspections of septic systems to ensure they are working correctly, and prompting municipalities to take actions to reduce runoff. The same types of algae crisis could occur elsewhere, Stepien warned. Any shallow water body rich in nutrients causing algae to grow is susceptible, including Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron, and Green Bay and areas around Chicago in Lake Michigan, she said. “I’m very discouraged that we have not been proactive during the past decade, despite knowing that this is happening,” she said. “In some ways, it might be good to have this type of emergency.”

 <strong> By KYLE KAMINSKI</strong > <em> The Record-Eagle</em> TRAVERSE CITY — A local roadway will remain partially closed following a recent tanker crash as crews work to clean up thousands of gallons of gasoline that spilled into a nearby field. Blair Township Fire Chief Bill Parker said the eastbound lane of Beitner Road from U.S. 31 to Williams Road is closed to traffic through Jan. 5. The westbound lane remains open but eastbound lanes will be detoured down Rennie School Road to Williams Road, he said. Michigan Department of Environmental Quality officials said about 5,700 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel spilled from a tanker truck following a crash on Christmas Eve. Portions of a nearby field will need to be excavated to remove contaminated soil, analyst Jarrett Hale previously said. Grand Traverse County sheriff's deputies said a 45-year-old Grawn woman — who they suspect could have been driving under the influence of marijuana — lost control of her SUV, crossed the centerline and collided head-on with the tanker truck. She broke several bones but her three passengers escaped with little to no injuries, deputies previously said. The tanker driver, a 42-year-old Alma man, was also uninjured in the crash. Three homes were also evacuated but families returned before Christmas Day.

 <strong>From the Associated Press</strong> BRIGHTON TWP. , Mich. (AP) — A lawsuit alleges that General Motors has contaminated water near a Michigan testing facility since the 1980s and has attempted to cover it up. Attorneys Edward J. Hood of the Detroit-based Clark Hill law firm and Alexander Memmen of the Chicago-based Memmen law firm filed the lawsuit Thursday on behalf of six Brighton Township residents. The lawsuit alleges that the Milford Proving Grounds contaminated water with high levels of sodium and chloride. The lawsuit said the facility released thousands of tons of salt over the past 30 years. The 4,000-acre vehicle testing site uses salt for maintenance, water treatment and other vehicle testing purposes. The lawsuit alleges the company has known about the high concentrations for years but didn't inform regulatory authorities or local residents. General Motors said the suit doesn't have merit, stating that salt deposits occur in the area naturally and salt is frequently used on the roads during winter. "Nonetheless, acting as a good neighbor, salt usage at the Milford Proving Ground has been reduced by 60 percent over the last two decades and GM submits regular reports on the groundwater quality at the Milford Proving Ground to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality," the company said. Prolonged exposure to high amounts of sodium and chloride can damage the liver and kidney, as well as cause hypertension and high blood pressure, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Memmen said he plans to seek class-action status on behalf of an estimated 100 other residents who may have been impacted by the contamination.

 <strong> By ED WHITE</strong > <em>Associated Press</em> DETROIT (AP) — State regulators say 91,000 bushels of soybeans must be destroyed, three years after just a small portion was grown on land that had sediment from a Kalamazoo River Superfund site in western Michigan. Only 145 bushels were harvested from the land. But here's the problem : Those soybeans were stored with thousands of additional bushels, likely worth more than $800,000 in fall 2016. The agriculture department said the soybeans are indistinguishable and can't be sorted. "That has magnified the ramifications," Brad Deacon, director of legal affairs at the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, told The Associated Press. "The unfortunate part is they were comingled with perfectly good grain from other farms." Since 2016, the soybeans have been locked up under state order in Hamilton in Allegan County. The 145 bushels were grown by Golden Grain Farms and sold for $1,300 to CHS, a global Minnesota-based farm cooperative with operations in Michigan. CHS recently filed a lawsuit against Golden Grain, seeking unspecified compensation for all 91,000 bushels and disclosing details about the unusual controversy. Golden Grain didn't return messages this week seeking comment. CHS declined to comment. Soybeans, which are high in protein, are typically turned into animal feed. But they're also used to make oil and food for human consumption as well as biodiesel fuel. The soybeans harvested by Golden Grain were grown on land that couldn't be used for farming, according to state regulators. The restriction was in place because dredged spoils, or sediment, from the Kalamazoo River had been placed on the land. The river was contaminated for years by polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCBs. CHS' lawsuit quotes Golden Grain owner Tom Brink as saying that growing soybeans on the soil was the "biggest mistake" of his life. Nonetheless, CHS and Golden Grain repeatedly reached out to the agriculture department to try to come up with a compromise. In a 2017 letter, Golden Grain's lawyer said there was no direct evidence that the soybeans were contaminated and any pollutants in the ground were insignificant. The state, however, wasn't swayed. Federal regulators supported the agriculture department. "The soybeans are not fit for human or animal use and destruction is the only viable path," Deacon told CHS in June. CHS has proposed sending the beans to a landfill or burning them.

 <strong>From The Muskegon Chronicle</strong> NORTH MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) — Officials will soon begin cleaning up lead and petroleum contamination from a former oil refinery in western Michigan. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality hope to make significant progress this year at the former Zephyr Oil Refinery site in Muskegon Township, the Muskegon Chronicle reported. The effort aims to remove 44,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediments from the site and nearby wetlands, said Sara Pearson with the DEQ's remediation and redevelopment division. "Our beautiful beach sand is black, it smells awful and is full of petroleum, so we needed to get it out," Pearson said. An estimated 150,000 gallons of petroleum percolated underground and spread once it hit the water table, she said. "The ground water helped it move," Pearson said. "It was most unfortunate then that the refinery has a groundwater divide underneath. That made the problem spread to about 100 acres." The Muskegon River's strong current helped pull contaminants away from drinking wells, she said. Cleanup crews will inject a liquid chemical agent in the soil at the site. The persulfate oxidizer compound will break down the harmful underground petroleum deposits. A hydraulic vacuum truck will suck up leftover chemicals and un-oxidized soil. Crews will begin in the middle of the site and work outward. "We know where the heavy spots are and where to target," Pearson said. "We're working in one grid at a time, and we have other wells out there that we can monitor and see how much we're influencing. If we haven't influenced enough or got enough out, we will 'wash, rinse and repeat.'" The EPA and the DEQ will monitor the site to watch for deposits that may have been overlooked, she said. Muskegon Lake is one of 43 toxic hotspots the United States and Canada have identified along the Great Lakes basin.

 <b> By KEITH MATHENY</b> Detroit Free Press (TNS) — A “pinhole leak” in a controversial petroleum pipeline running through the Upper Peninsula released an undetermined amount of natural gas liquid that dispersed into the atmosphere north of Manistique, near the Indian River, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced Tuesday. A spokesman for Canadian oil transport giant Enbridge, which operates the Line 5 pipeline, however, said it not a leak, but a “pinhole-sized defect, observed in the weld of the pipe,” during a planned investigation of the pipeline Dec. 8. Leak or defect, the incident heightened concerns among some people about a 61-year-old stretch of the pipeline that runs underwater through the Straits of Mackinac, and what a spill there could do to the Great Lakes. Enbridge transports light crude oil, light synthetic crude, and natural gas liquids through the line. “This small leak is a wake-up call,” said David Holtz, chair of the Michigan Chapter of the nonprofit Sierra Club. State and federal agencies should publicly disclose the full extent of potential environmental threats from the pipeline, he added, and open a public debate “about whether the threat to our state’s waters and land are too great a risk to take.” Enbridge spokesman Jason Manshum said the weld defect “created a small, dime-sized stain on the pipe,” and that there was “no impact from the release to the air or the soil.” Regulators were notified when the planned pipeline repair met reporting criteria, he said. “Our maintenance program detected even this minor irregularity, indicating the ability of our program to maintain Line 5 pipeline integrity,” he said. “This is a clear example of how we are working to identify and repair anomalies before there is any impact to the environment or those who live and work along our pipelines.” The Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force, a joint review of the state’s pipeline infrastructure and its safety being conducted by Schuette and state Department of Environmental Quality Director Dan Wyant, was briefed Monday on the incident near Manistique. “We want to assure the public that the task force and DEQ will keep a close watch on the status of this incident to ensure the leak has been properly repaired and any environmental impacts have been reviewed,” Schuette and Wyant said in a joint statement. “This incident underscores the importance of the task force as it continues an exhaustive review of the safety of petroleum pipe lines in Michigan, and to implement every possible safety precaution to protect the ecology and the economy of the Great Lakes.” It was an Enbridge oil transmission line that burst near Marshall in July 2010, causing the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history, decimating Talmadge Creek and polluting about a 35-mile stretch of the Kalamazoo River. The $1 billion-plus cleanup took more than four years, and some area residents still question its completeness. Gilbert Baker, supervisor of Schoolcraft County’s Hiawatha Township, where the Line 5 pinhole leak occurred, said he was not informed about the incident — and he’s not happy about it. “It’s very easy to make a phone call and let us know,” he said, adding he also questions the company’s assurances that public health and the environment were not impacted. “If they don’t know how much leaked, how do they know?” he said.

 <strong>By Leonard N. Fleming</strong> <em> The Detroit News</em> Michigan has the most PFAS sites in the nation, but state officials are improving testing and accountability for the harmful substances, according to report released Monday by a national environmental advocacy group. The report finds that Michigan has 192 PFAS sites, much higher than the state's 49 official contamination sites. The report's number is much higher because the Washington, D.C.-based Environmental Working Group includes sites like schools or apartment buildings where testing found levels of PFAS below the federal health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion — in many cases, showing minute traces such as 2 parts or 4 parts per trillion. The group is seeking a PFAS standard of 1 part per trillion because it considers the chemicals to be incredibly toxic. PFAS are a class of chemicals long used in firefighting foam, tanneries, metal platers, Scotchgard and Teflon. They have been linked to health risks such as thyroid disease, increased cholesterol levels, and kidney and testicular cancers. The Environmental Working Group teamed up with the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute at Northeastern University to study and map the effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the so-called forever chemicals. The interactive map with data updated through March show at least 610 locations in 43 states that now has traces to large amounts of PFAS in the drinking water systems of an estimated 19 million people. The data comes from the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System which has tracked PFAS contamination with data from the states, the group said. The PFAS has been primarily found at airports, industrial plants and dumps, military bases and firefighter training sites. State testing found a Grand Haven area school and Parchment Township's water system near Kalamazoo had excessive levels of PFAS. Bill Walker, the vice president and editor in chief of the Environmental Working Group, said the PFAS "contamination problem is obviously severe" in Michigan, but the high number of cases is largely due to the state's aggressive efforts. "Truly, it's sort of like a good news-bad news thing in that Michigan's clearly the epicenter of a crisis right now but the state's effort is really making our point for us in that when you look for the stuff, you do find it," Walker said. "We still believe that we are still only seeing sort of the tip of the iceberg of contamination nationwide because not every place has had the kind of comprehensive testing that Michigan is undertaking." The Michigan PFAS Action Response Team's formal vetting process has confirmed 49 contaminated sites and there are four additional areas of interest, according to officials from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. EGLE spokesman Scott Dean did not dispute the report's findings but said "the only reason Michigan shows a large number of PFAS sites is because we are one of the few states that is actively looking for the contamination." "While most states are taking a wait-and-see approach and the federal government moves slowly, here in Michigan, we're committed to working together to root out this contaminant, protect at-risk populations, and drive down exposure levels," Dean said. "No state is moving faster along so many fronts. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also has ordered state environmental experts to begin developing stricter drinking water standards for PFAS compounds because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking too long to create its own new guidelines. "I haven't seen anything like it in any other state," Walker said. "Michigan is not only looking at drinking water, they are testing private wells, they've tested surface water, they've tested ground water. They've even issued advisories for fish and wildlife, which I'm not really sure any other state has done." Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, who has criticized the EPA for moving too slowly on improving standards for PFAS testing, said the PFAS problem in Michigan screams for attention. "This study confirms what we already know: The PFAS crisis is impacting many communities across Michigan and the country," he said in a statement. "We cannot afford to wait any longer to address PFAS contamination, which can have devastating health impacts. That's why I'm continuing to work on efforts in the Senate to ensure our drinking water is safe, prevent exposure to contamination, reduce harm to human health and expedite clean-up and assistance for affected communities." Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist for the Environmental Working Group, said the state monitoring is "very helpful" especially for tap water. A broken regulatory system has resulted in people being exposed to contaminated drinking water, Temkin said. "Now we a public health risk because of that," she said.

 Caption Close By MICHAEL BIESECKER and JASON DEAREN Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency is touting cleanups at seven of the nation's most polluted places as a signature accomplishment in the Trump administration's effort to reduce the number of Superfund sites, even though records show the physical work was completed before President Donald Trump took office. The agency earlier this week credited the leadership of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt with tripling the number of sites fully or partially removed from the Superfund's National Priorities List in 2017, compared with the two sites taken off in the Obama administration's last year. "We have made it a priority to get these sites cleaned up faster and in the right way," said Pruitt. He said that, with the agency's moves to create a task force and make those responsible for contamination pay for cleanup, "the Superfund program is carrying out the agency's mission of protecting human health and the environment more every day." Cleanups of Superfund sites usually take decades, spanning presidential administrations. An analysis of EPA records by The Associated Press shows that overall the seven Superfund sites delisted last year fell short of the average pace set under both the administrations of Barack Obama and George W. Bush, even in their opening years. All told, EPA averaged delisting more than 10 sites a year under the eight years Obama was in the White House. EPA under Bush delisted nearly 18 sites on average annually during his two terms. Still, the EPA said Pruitt's initiatives had resulted in "significant improvement." EPA declined Friday to provide details of procedural changes under Pruitt that led to the seven sites being delisted faster. "In 2016, President Obama's EPA cleaned up two Superfund sites, but rather than cherry-pick individual years, it would only be fair to judge us upon the completion of our tenure," said Jahan Wilcox, an EPA spokesman. "Under Administrator Pruitt's leadership, we've completed the cleanup of seven toxic land sites and this is just the beginning." Records show that construction work at all seven sites hyped by Pruitt's EPA, such as removing soil or drilling wells to suck out contaminated groundwater, was completed years before Pruitt was confirmed as the agency's chief in February. Removing sites from the list is a procedural step that occurs after monitoring data show that remaining levels of harmful contaminates meet cleanup targets, which were often set by EPA decades ago. Further, entries in the U.S. Federal Register showed that EPA announced its move in 2016 to withdraw four of the seven sites — the Ellisville Site in Missouri, the Omaha Lead site in Nebraska, North Penn in Pennsylvania and the Perdido Groundwater Contamination site in Alabama. The planned deletions of two others, the Shpack Landfill in Massachusetts and the Mystery Bridge site in Wyoming, were announced prior to Pruitt's May 22 directive establishing the Superfund task force. Notice of EPA's intent to remove the last of the seven sites, Nutting Truck & Caster Co. in Minnesota, was Aug. 21. There are currently more than 1,300 Superfund sites on EPA's National Priorities List at various stages in the cleanup process, and sites are routinely added to or deleted from the list each year. Sites are fully deleted after contamination is addressed across an entire property, often a former industrial site. Partial deletions occur when part of a larger site is cleaned up, but work remains to be completed on other sections. Sites removed from the list are sometimes clean enough to be used for new housing or commercial development, though many still have levels of contamination that require deed restrictions on how the land can be used in the future. Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general who has moved to roll back dozens of EPA regulations intended to reduce future pollution, has said increasing the number of sites deleted from the priority list and cleared for redevelopment will be a focus of the agency under his watch. To lead his task force on the issue, Pruitt tapped Albert "Kell" Kelly, a former Oklahoma bank executive who now serves as a senior adviser at EPA, despite having no prior experience as an environmental regulator. A former EPA official said the agency's work was underway before Pruitt acted. "The agency was already doing what's in the task force report," said Phyllis Anderson, former associate director of the EPA division that manages Superfund cleanups. She retired in 2013 after 30 years at the agency, serving in Republican and Democratic administrations. Records show the Bush administration's higher count of delistings was largely the result of work EPA completed in the 1990s, when federal spending on Superfund cleanups was roughly twice what it is now. President Donald Trump's proposed 2018 budget seeks to cut the Superfund program by 30 percent, though Congress has not yet approved a budget for the year. Pruitt says he will accomplish more with less money through better management. Dearen reported from Gainesville, Florida.

Lennar told them the development wouldn't be completed until the early 2030s. But people held out, thinking the wait would be worth it when the promised amenities, like parks, office space, supermarkets, and an outdoor mall, arrived alongside their industrial-chic condos. The shipyard residents who spoke with Business Insider said they now believe the development's timeline is no longer realistic The city of San Francisco, which accepts land from the Navy and transfers it to the shipyard developers, won't allow development in the surrounding area until the Navy can show that it's clean and safe. Five Point says the Last fall, the Navy received the results of a third-party data review that found Tetra Tech, a government contractor tasked with identifying and removing hazardous waste at the retired shipyard, had botched the cleanup before construction even began. Former Tetra Tech workers claimed to have In 2015, Five Point and Lennar, which is responsible for building and selling the first 926 homes at the shipyard, planned to deliver 800,000 square feet of office space and 1,400 housing units by 2018, according to The area remains mostly unwalkable, with little public transit, "I feel like I'm in the middle of a suburb with nowhere to go, and it's been that way in our neighborhood for quite a while," said Rick, who is retired. "There really is nothing." Business Insider spoke with about a dozen residents at public meetings held at the shipyard since January. Some said they feared that the value of their real-estate investments would slide after the reports outlining fraud, while others worried for their family's safety. The homes at the shipyard sit on a hill above the naval base, where military housing and administrative offices once overlooked the San Francisco Bay. The Navy says it doesn't plan to retest this swath because the military never found "These people are absolutely 100% safe," Derek Robinson, the Navy's environmental coordinator for the shipyard, told Business Insider in January. On Tuesday, 149 residents of the nearby Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood But shipyard residents most often cited concerns about the development's future. The first settlers of the shipyard, located on an overlooked patch of San Francisco's southern waterfront, bought in with the expectation that a community would rise around them over the next 1o to 15 years. But the plans may be further delayed if the Navy has to redo the cleanup because some parcels there may still be contaminated with radioactive pollution. At a meeting of homeowners and About a dozen residents sat quietly for the first hour. Sometime after the architect addressed the new road infrastructure but before he proposed a water-treatment center, a resident named Jason Fried stood up. Lennar had sold him on "a bill of goods," Fried said, and he wondered when the developer would start delivering on its promises. On the screen, a small disclaimer at the bottom of the slideshow said: "There is no guarantee that the project will be approved, developed, or built as shown." "I'll tell you this much: I was shown a lot of pictures of things that have not been built, and they did not have this disclaimer on it," said Fried, a former political organizer. Other residents piped up. Eric Vanderpool, a lawyer, asked about the status of the Navy's investigation. He wanted to know how the delays would affect development. Five Point's CEO said in a recent Homeowners expressed disappointment that Five Point would build more homes before developing more parks. The site's single park is a popular gathering place for residents, and construction on the much larger "Part of your promise to our neighborhood before any of this was built was that we'd have parks," said Richard Laufman, who lives nearby and is part of a local neighborhood association.

Few residents said they're worried about coming into contact with radioactive contamination at the shipyard, because their homes sit where military barracks — as opposed to nuclear-testing facilities — used to be. They're concerned about the shipyard's future more than its past. There's an insatiable hunger for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the At the shipyard, the first group of 88 townhouses and condos sold out about eight months after Lennar started sales in 2015 — a feat that the nation's largest home builder Residents told Business Insider that life at the shipyard has fallen short of their expectations. Back in 2015, when Lennar sold the first homes, the website showed off the developer's ambitions, with the words "Welcome Visionaries" splashed across the home page. According to Bike paths and a new rapid-transit bus system would connect the area to downtown San Francisco. Residents might work out of an on-site business incubator, enjoy local bands and speakers at a 10,000-seat arts venue, and "share in community over arts, crafts, fabrics, clothing, and food" at an outdoor plaza called the International African Marketplace. The plans for the shipyard are more or less the same, but some residents question whether it's still possible that these amenities will be delivered on time amid delays with the land transfer. The shipyard is still an active construction site, with crews cranking away on more housing and infrastructure. In nearby Candlestick Park, workers are preparing the land for development of a Fried, who moved into the shipyard in 2015, said he feels as if Lennar took his money and "stopped caring." He remembered visiting the sales office before he bought a condo and being pitched on a pocket park that would be steps from his door. Later, Lennar told him that the city intended to build affordable-housing units on the land instead. The park has been scrapped. David and Rick, the couple who moved into the shipyard last year, said the developer showed them an artist's renderings of the neighborhood before they bought their home, which was previously owned. The plans featured the same park catty-corner from their condo. Rick said he is frustrated that he often finds out about changes to the development plan through neighbors and the news, rather than from Lennar and Five Point. Other residents echoed his concern, claiming that Lennar and Five Point have been poorly communicating with residents. "Don't throw people out here and then say, 'You're on your own — too bad,'" he said. Lennar declined to comment on claims made by shipyard residents for this story. In the past year, shipyard residents have started organizing. They gather in a private Facebook group and on email threads, sharing the stories that Lennar and Five Point tell them. <img alt="sf shipyard hunters point 1812 " border="0" src="//static4.businessinsider.com/image/5a144b21f914c356018b545e-2000/sf-shipyard-hunters-point-1812.jpg"/> Finding buyers for new shipyard condos has proved more difficult in 2018 than 2014, when residents looked to the area as the last bastion of affordable housing in the city. At least six prospective buyers have broken contracts to buy homes at the shipyard "out of concern for their health and safety," according to a memo sent by Lennar obtained through a public-records request and reviewed by the Still, out of the about 260 townhouses and condos sold at the shipyard, only a handful have been relisted.

Units ranging in size between one and three bedrooms slide in price from the high $600,000s to $1.5 million.

Lead poisoning is Even barely-detectable levels of lead in children's' bloodstreams But the ongoing crisis in Flint, Michigan brought to light how limited and unequal the efforts to un-lead America have been. And a new study The researchers used advanced statistical modeling based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey —which does its own lead screening on kids all over the country — to predict how many children They found that for every one of the more than 600,000 cases of childhood lead poisoning reported to the CDC between 1999 and 2010, another poisoned child went undetected. That's 600,000 cases of lead poisoning missing from the official record, which brings the total to 1.2 million cases across the United States in that time period. That problem seems to stem from the fact that the US got ahead of itself when it came to tackling lead contamination. The number of lead poisoning cases declined dramatically toward the end of the 20th Century. Thanks to efforts from the Environmental Protection Agency, lead was In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control recommended that every child in America be screened for lead in their bloodstreams. By 1997, amid falling rates, those standards were relaxed. The CDC decided that each state could decide for itself whether to screen for and report lead poisoning — though the CDC said poorer families reliant on Medicaid (and more at risk of living in contaminated areas) should still ideally be screened. By 2009, even that recommendation was "softened," so states weren't expected to push Medicaid recipients toward screening Because of that, the researchers write, <img alt="Screen Shot 2017 05 03 at 12.27.40 PM" src="https://static5.businessinsider.com/image/590a055b2ceae951028b4a81-1622/screen-shot-2017-05-03-at-122740-pm.png"/> According to the researchers' estimates, certain areas of the country miss more cases of lead poisoning than others. Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, and Washington all miss at least 80% of lead poisoning cases, the researchers suggest, even though they report the lead poisoning cases they catch to the CDC. Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, South Carolina, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Utah and don't report any cases at all to the CDC, and don't participate in standardized national screening processes. Some states, mostly in the Northeast and upper Midwest, seem to catch a majority of cases, but there are just 10 states (New York, Ohio, Missouri, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Connecticut, Illinois, and Rhode Island) that seem to catch more than 90%. Most of the undetected cases are likely concentrated in poor and minority areas in the South and West, and many likely have poisoning rates Now, the researchers write, the task for public health officials is to find them. < a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/lead-poisoning-states-us-2017-5?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content =allverticals#comments">Join the conversation about this story » </a> NOW WATCH: <b>See Also:</b> <strong>SEE ALSO: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/most-polluted-cities-in-us-2017-4?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content= allverticals">The 25 most dangerously polluted cities in the US</a></strong>

The Department of Energy oversees Hanford. It's a Cold War-era facility that The site no longer produces plutonium. However, millions of gallons' worth of radioactive waste is still stored there, and workers are carrying out a lengthy process of decommissioning the nuclear reservation, which The Seattle Times The 586-square-mile site was put under a precautionary "take cover" order on Tuesday because a tunnel containing radioactive materials partially caved in, according to a Officials are trying to determine how to address the busted tunnel, according to the bulletin. <img alt="hanford site purex facility map location doe " data-link="http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/ProjectsFacilities" src="https://static4.businessinsider.com/image/59120b42d9f40631008b4c41-1201/hanford-site-purex-facility-map-location-doe.png"/> On Tuesday at 11:26 a.m. Eastern, Hanford posted Two long rail yard tunnels feed into the plant. About half-dozen workers discovered the hole in earth covering one of the tunnels this morning, triggering the evacuation, Destry Henderson, a spokesman for the Hanford Emergency Center, said during "All personnel in the immediate area have been accounted for, they are safe, and there's been no evidence for a radiological release," Henderson said. "Upon an additional investigation, crews noticed a portion of that tunnel had fallen — the roof had caved in — about a 20-foot section of that tunnel, which is more than 100 feet long." <img alt="hanford site purex facility railroad tunnel area " data-link="http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/PUREX" src="https://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5911fa8473f2f31b008b4ca8-753/hanford-site-purex-facility-railroad-tunnel-area.png"/> The later discovery of the roof cave-in triggered a broader safety alert, since such an incident may have led to a release of radioactive materials. "All of the employees on the Hanford Site have been told to take cover. What that means is shelter in place," Henderson said. "This is purely precautionary, because again, no employees were hurt and there was no spread — no indication of a spread of radiological contamination." <img alt="hanford site purex facility rail yard tunnel collapse doe labeled" data-link="http://www.hanford.gov/c.cfm/eoc/?page=290" src="https://static6.businessinsider.com/image/59121809d9f406a7008b4ccb-1600/hanford-site-purex-facility-rail-yard-tunnel-collapse-doe -labeled.png"/> Soon after the collapse, Susannah Frame, a reporter with KING 5 TV in Seattle, Lynne T., a member of the joint information center with the Energy Department, who would not provide a last name, told Business Insider that "the tunnels do contain contaminated materials," though "there's no evidence of any injuries, and all employees have been accounted for. There's also no confirmation that any radioactive material has been released." She said the Hanford Fire Department was "on the scene and investigating it, and everyone is being sheltered," adding that no one appeared to be hurt and that fewer than 10 people were inside the PUREX facility. Frame has posted pictures of the site, including one of a TALON military-grade robot that's being used to determine whether there's a leak of radioactive materials. Some reports suggest vibrations from nearby road work may have caused the tunnel roof collapse. However, Henderson said it was "too early to know what caused the roof to cave in," and "we may not know that for some time." <img alt="hanford site purex facility doe" data-link="http://www.hanford.gov/page.cfm/PUREX#PUREX2" src="https://static5.businessinsider.com/image/59120cff73f2f3f7038b4d13 -800/hanford-site-purex-facility-doe.jpg"/> The PUREX facility was the "workhorse" of Cold War-era production of plutonium-239 (Pu-239), a fissile material that can be used in bombs to create Rods of uranium fuel were irradiated in nuclear reactors at Hanford to form Pu-239, then trained into the PUREX facility for processing. The fuel rods were dissolved with acid to sort any plutonium from leftover uranium fuel and radioactive waste. The plant "is longer than three football fields, stands 64 feet above the ground, and extends another 40 feet below ground," according to the Hanford website, and "concrete walls up to 6 feet thick were used in the plant to shield workers from the radiation of the building." According to Hanford: "Built in the early 1950s, the facility went into operation in 1956. From 1956 to 1972, and again from 1983 until 1988, PUREX processed about 75% of the plutonium produced at Hanford. Some scientists believe that more plutonium was processed at PUREX than any other building on the planet, as it processed more than 70,000 tons of uranium fuel rods during its operations. "The building has been vacant for nearly 20 years, but it remains highly contaminated. Its walls are surrounded by razor wire and barbed wire fences. Several rail cars used to transport the irradiated fuel rods from the Hanford nuclear reactors to the processing canyons are temporarily buried inside a tunnel near PUREX as a result of becoming contaminated. "As with the rest of the Hanford structures, PUREX is slated to be decontaminated, demolished, and some of its debris removed. The rail cars buried next to the facility will also be decontaminated, removed, and permanently buried. Although, the option of grouting the rail cars in-place within the tunnel is being evaluated, since removal of the cars would entail extreme worker safety hazards and would be more costly than grouting in-place."

 Caption Close Residents of a long-polluted section of South Park reacted Sunday with a range of emotions from nonchalance to concern about the revelation that a new and more toxic threat -- dioxins -- has turned up in their midst. That family of chemicals is potent enough -- believed to promote cancer and other bad health effects -- that scientists measure dioxins in parts per trillion. Most other contaminants are measured in parts per billion or parts per million. On Sunday, days after a second round of tests revealed dioxins, this time at the site of a now-leveled asphalt plant, several residents said they had not been contacted by authorities about the dioxins. Most said they were not taking any special precautions. "I got one piece of mail and that's it," said Marshall, recounting how the first farmers to sell to Pike Place Market grew crops in what's now the gritty neighborhood he calls home, said he has plans to live in South Park for only a few years. So he's not very concerned. He's there for the cheap rent, then he's out of there. But, Marshall said, many people will live in the neighborhood a long time. "There's a lot of children around here -- immigrants' children -- and I don't think the Hispanic community is as adept at knowing what's going on here" because of language barriers, Marshall said. Just down the street, at a rental property near some newly built townhomes, renter Although authorities advise residents to take certain steps to protect themselves against exposure to dioxins, such as removing their shoes before entering their homes, Murphy didn't remember any such instructions. "People responsible for (the pollution) need to be chastised," Murphy said. The test results announced Thursday focused on the asphalt plant. But another round of tests earlier this month showed dioxins in residents' yards, sometimes at levels that significantly topped the state cleanup standard for homes --11 parts dioxin per trillion parts of soil. Those first results of the tests on residents' yards showed the highest concentration at 397 parts dioxin per trillion parts soil. However, corrections on the laboratory work last week showed the highest reading was actually 100 parts per trillion. In the second set of tests, on the Malarkey plant site, the highest reading in the early uncorrected test results announced last week was 297 parts dioxin per trillion parts soil. Much remains to be done to understand the total picture, said BJ Cummings, coordinator of the "I personally don't think we have enough information," Cummings said shortly after the latest test results were released. "We don't know if it came from here and went to there. I'm going to tell the community that, yeah, they found some dioxin. "But if anybody says, 'What does that mean?' I'm going to say I don't know." A big clue will be pinpointing what kinds of dioxins are being found where. Dioxins are a family of about 75 chemicals. The lab tests run so far simply measured total dioxins. Dioxins come from sources that include burning material such as garbage, oil and coal; paper plant waste, and cigarette smoke. And there's another important source of dioxins, according to the federal PCBs are known to have been burned in the Malarkey asphalt plant's furnace. They were contaminants in oil provided to the asphalt company for free in the early 1970s by The city is coordinating testing and any needed cleanup of the neighborhood, while the Port of Seattle, which bought the property where the old asphalt plant was located, is handling that parcel. It is covered with asphalt and fenced off so the public has no access. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= seattlenews&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex =solr&amp;query=%22Roy+Kuroiwa%22">Roy Kuroiwa</a> "There's a lot of work going on, with a lot of smart people who are looking at this," Kuroiwa said. "Dioxin is a very, very difficult contaminant to evaluate. It's a fairly new contaminant in our business, a more recent urban contaminant that we're starting to look at." South Park Marina resident "I just wonder if this (pollution) doesn't have something to do with my dog's condition," he said.

"It doesn't show where we are at right now," Shaun McGrath, Region 8 administrator for the EPA, told Hickenlooper, EPA Chief Gina McCarthy is expected to tour the area today. Ellen Wohl, a geoscience professor at Colorado State University told Business Insider she thinks the governor's push to reopen the river doesn't necessarily reflect the river's health, but rather, pressure to get boating and other recreational activities going again on the river. Even if the pH and heavy metal levels have returned to normal for now, she said, it doesn't mean they won't be a problem in the next few decades. The metals will stick around for a while, clinging to the silt and clay at the bottom of the river. "There's the < span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the contaminated water is < a href="http://www2.epa.gov/goldkingmine">still flowing</a> out of the mine , even if the levels are normal that doesn't mean the worst is over.

Wohl said this process could take months. </span> < a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/when-will-the-animas-river-in-colorado-re-open-2015-8?utm_source= hearst&amp;utm_medium= referral&amp;utm_content =allverticals#comments">Join the conversation about this story » </a> NOW WATCH: <b>See Also:</b> <strong >UP NEXT: < a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/great-white-shark-jumping-video-2015-8?utm_source= hearst&amp;utm_medium= referral&amp;utm_content =allverticals">Watch a great white shark unbelievably launch itself into mid-air</a></strong> <strong >CHECK OUT: < a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/china-pollution-is-causing-high-ozone-in-the-us-2015-8?utm_source=hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=allverticals">Wind is blowing China's air pollution 'straight across' to the US West Coast</a></strong>

Despite the best efforts of doctors, she died in hospital eight days later. Rowley, who was He said he couldn't remember where he found the box, but because the bottle appeared unused and packaged in a well-known brand, it "made me think it was quite safe." Salisbury MP John Glen told BBC radio earlier this month that the couple had a "habit of looking into bins." Rowley said: "It looked expensive, unfortunately it turned out to be a bad find." London's Metropolitan Police, which is leading the investigation, told Business Insider in a statement that more than 400 items had been extracted from the surrounding area as part of the Amesbury investigation, "of which a significant number are potentially contaminated." Rowley also revealed that he had handled the "oily substance" himself before giving it to Sturgess, but washed it off immediately. He said: "I guess how I got in contact with it is when I put the spray part to the bottle. I ended tipping some on my hands, but I washed it off under the tap. "It had an oily substance and I smelt it and it didn't smell of perfume. It felt oily, so I washed it off really quick but I didn't think anything of it. It all happened so quick." Washing his hands immediately after touching the substance may have been what saved his life, ITV News said. <img alt="amesbury poisoning stretcher" border="0" data-link="https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/1014557786871656448" src="https://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5b3def7965de7819008b4849-989/amesbury-poisoning-stretcher.png"/> Rowley also provided a glimpse into what it's like to fall ill from novichok poisoning. Upon spraying the liquid onto her wrists, Sturgess complained of a headache and said she needed to lie down in the bath, Rowley said. He told ITV News: "Within 15 minutes, I believe Dawn said she felt she had a headache and asked me if I had any headache tablets. I had a look around the flat and within that time she said she felt peculiar and needed to lie down in the bath, which at the time I thought was a bit strange. "I went into the bathroom and found her in the bath, fully clothed, in a very ill state." He added that he doesn't remember falling ill, but was told by friends that he was "stumbling" and "foaming" at the mouth before he was taken into hospital. <img alt="Skripals" border="0 " src="https://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5ac6440e7ec3bbf5358b4627-1500 /skripals.jpg"/> Rowley's story conforms to a theory that he and his girlfriend were The Skripals collapsed in Salisbury, a town near Amesbury, in March and were immediately taken critically ill. Both father and daughter lived, and have since been discharged. Investigators are currently trying to find out whether the novichok that poisoned Sturgess and Rowley were from the same batch from the Skripal attack, the Met told Business Insider. They said "we cannot guarantee that there isn't any more of the substance left." Britain has accused Russia of being behind the Skripal attack, but the Kremlin has repeatedly denied it. Rowley told ITV News: "I think it was very irresponsible for people to leave the poison for anybody to pick up. It could have been children. It was just so unfortunate. I'm very angry at the whole incident." The Met said: "The search process linked with both the Amesbury and the Salisbury investigation has been one of the most complex and difficult that UK policing has ever faced but it is crucial that police do not make assumptions, and that we follow the evidence." <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/novichok-oily-substance-disguised-as-perfume-charlie-rowley-2018-7?utm_source= hearst&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content =allverticals#comments">Join the conversation about this story » </a> NOW WATCH: <b>See Also:</b>

The FDA has also In response to the Consumer Reports investigation, Keurig Dr Pepper confirmed that it had detected average arsenic levels of 17 parts per billion. That same week, the company said it would suspend production of bottled water for two weeks to improve its filtration system. Starkey's arsenic levels, on the other hand, have tiptoed around the FDA threshold. After testing four samples of the bottled-water brand, Consumer Reports found levels ranging from about 9.5 parts per billion (just below the FDA limit) to 10.1 parts per billion (just above the FDA limit). In December 2016, Florida regulators The CEH said its findings "almost exactly" confirm the tests from Consumer Reports and have been verified by an independent lab, but it wouldn't disclose the specific levels of arsenic, citing pending litigation. The group has sent legal notices to Whole Foods and Keurig Dr Pepper, telling the companies that their bottled water exceeds the arsenic limit set by California's Proposition 65, a state law that requires businesses to alert consumers about significant exposures to toxic chemicals. "Bottled water companies need to take the necessary steps to remove this toxic metal from their products, and retailers should stop selling them now," Caroline Cox, a senior scientist at CEH, said in a statement. "Until those conditions are met, we recommend consumers avoid purchasing Whole Foods' Starkey and Dr Pepper's Peñafiel." Walmart and Keurig Dr Pepper did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment. On June 21, Keurig Dr Pepper Whole Foods said it had tested the same samples cited by Consumer Reports and found that the products were fully compliant with FDA standards. The company would not comment on the CEH investigation. "We would never sell products that do not meet FDA requirements," the company said. <img alt="bottled water plastic bottles shutterstock_1343064 " border="0" data-link="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/water-bottles-blue-cups-shallow-dof-1343064" src="https://static4.businessinsider.com/image/58d2ac4cd349f91f008b62d2-2048/bottled-water-plastic-bottles-shutterstock1343064.jpg" style="float:right;"/> Like any chemical, the more arsenic you consume, the more it poses a danger to human health.

 MULBERRY, Fla. (AP) — Dozens of residents who live near a Florida fertilizer plant that has leaked more than 200 million gallons of contaminated water into a drinking water aquifer have asked for their water wells to be tested for pollutants. The Mosaic Co., the world's largest phosphate provide and owner of the plant, said it had received 70 requests for well water testing, which it will provide for free. The move comes weeks after a leak was discovered on Aug. 27 at its New Wales facility in central Florida after a sinkhole opened up under a pile of contaminated waste. Florida Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Dee Ann Miller says there is no evidence the contaminated water has moved beyond the site and is threatening groundwater supplies. The leak occurred after a sinkhole opened beneath a pile of waste material called a "gypsum stack." A pond atop the pile drained into the sinkhole, reaching the aquifer, Mosaic said. While the company alerted state and federal environmental agencies in August, the public was not notified until last week. The sinkhole allowed the water to migrate into The Floridan aquifer, a major source of drinking water in the state. It's one of the highest producing aquifers in the world and underlies all of Florida and southern Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. The cities of Tallahassee, Jacksonville, Gainesville, Orlando, Daytona Beach, Tampa, and St. Petersburg all rely on the aquifer and it also supplies water to thousands of domestic, industrial and irrigation wells throughout the state. The DEP's Miller says the waste water pond was emptied by the sinkhole, but some seepage continues through the stack into the ground. "Mosaic continues to capture the process water by pumping through its system of recovery wells," she said in an email. " Again, monitoring to date indicates that the process water is being successfully contained and groundwater monitoring will continue to ensure there are no offsite or long-term effects." Mosaic did not return a message seeking comment.

 WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy is contributing at least $1 million to protect a river, lake and wetlands near Wilmington to settle a lawsuit over coal ash stored at a closed power plant. The company announced in a news release the money will be used to create the Cape Fear River Restoration and Preservation Fund. The utility promised Wednesday to match up to $250,000 given to the fund by other donors. A state judge ordered Duke Energy to dig up coal ash from the now closed Sutton power plant near Wilmington. Environmental groups also sued in federal court, saying the coal ash had contaminated Sutton Lake. The Southern Environmental Law Center says the utility has settled lawsuits with the group over eight of its coal powered plants with six of them remaining unresolved.

 Caption Close RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — Duke Energy has agreed to remove millions of tons of coal ash containing toxic heavy metals from a power plant in North Carolina. The nation's largest electricity company announced Wednesday that it would dig up three huge pits of water-logged ash at the Buck Steam Station near Salisbury. The ash will be dried and either offered for use in making concrete or moved to lined landfills elsewhere. Duke agreed to remove the dumps to settle a federal lawsuit filed two years ago by the Southern Environmental Law Center. The ash — left behind when coal is burned to generate electricity — contains such toxic chemicals as lead and mercury, which over time can seep into the groundwater. Duke's handling of coal ash and the company's sometimes cozy relationship with state regulators has been under scrutiny since a dump at a different Duke plant ruptured in 2014, coating miles of the Dan River in gray sludge The Associated Press soon reported that concerning levels of chemicals contained in coal ash were found in drinking-water wells in Dukeville, a rural hamlet adjacent to the Buck plant. Among them, hexavalent chromium is known to cause lung cancer when inhaled, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it is likely to be carcinogenic when ingested. Duke denies its dumps contaminated the wells but has been providing bottled water to the residents.

 SEATTLE (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday finalized water-quality rules for Washington state tied partly to how much fish people eat, approving some aspects of the state's plan but deciding in many cases to set stricter limits than the state had wanted. The action comes years after contentious debate over the issue of how clean the state's rivers and bays need to be so people can safely eat fish from those waters. Businesses and local governments have argued that too strict rules could cost billions with little benefit to the environment, while Native American tribes and environmental groups said tougher rules are needed to reduce water pollution and protect those who eat fish. The EPA said the combination of its own federal rules and parts of the state's plan will protect residents who eat fish and shellfish from exposure to toxic pollutants. Maia Bellon, director of the state Department of Ecology, said she's disappointed the "state's approach wasn't accepted in its entirety. " The state worked hard to balance protecting human health and the environment while helping businesses and local governments comply, she said in a statement. The EPA agreed with Washington state on several key factors used to regulate water quality, including dramatically raising the fish-consumption rate to 175 grams a day, which would protect people who eat about a serving of fish a day. But it did not approve the state's plan for three major chemicals including PCBs, arsenic and mercury. Factories, wastewater plants and other point-source polluters are not the source of these chemicals, and the EPA's rule is "asking for big investments from the wrong people," said Rob Duff, a senior policy adviser with the governor's office. In the case of PCBs, the EPA rule is 25 times more stringent than what the state had proposed, Ecology officials said. Boeing, industry groups and cities and counties had argued against the EPA's limits for PCBs and mercury would be costly and difficult to meet. Boeing declined Tuesday to comment on the decision. Chris Wilke, executive director of Puget Soundkeeper Alliance, said the EPA got it right. "The state had kicked the can on mercury and PCBs, and EPA today said that we have to move forward with stronger regulations on those two," he said. "The main points that we were pushing on, we're happy with the results." But Carl Schroeder with the Association of Washington Cities said he's unsure how hundreds of wastewater plants will be able to comply with some of the new regulations, because no current technology exists, for example, to meet the standards for PCBs. Both the EPA and the state had each been working on parallel versions of the rules after the federal government last year stepped in to ensure that Washington did a rule in time. The state submitted its plan to the EPA for approval in August. The EPA was under a court order to finalize a plan by Tuesday, after environmental groups sued to force quicker action. On Tuesday, the EPA approved nearly one-quarter of the pollution standards the state adopted and finalized its own updates for the remaining three-quarters. The Northwest Pulp & Paper Association said it was "extremely disappointed" in EPA's final rule. The rule fails to incorporate the input of private businesses and public agencies and "sets up a system for failure, litigation and permitting uncertainty," the group said in a statement. But Lorraine Loomis, who leads the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission, praised the EPA for its leadership for finalizing "more protective water quality standards for everyone who lives here." "Strong water quality standards are important because they help protect us from toxins in our water that end up in the fish and shellfish we eat," she said in a statement.

 RENO, Nev. (AP) — After decades of resistance from the state of Nevada, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is taking the final steps to add an abandoned copper mine in Yerington to the list of the nation's most polluted Superfund sites. The EPA formally proposed the National Priority Listing of the World War II era-mine in the Federal Register on Thursday — 31 years after Nevada regulators first accused Anaconda Mining Co. of illegally discharging pollutants from the toxic site 80 miles southeast of Reno. "Other cleanup options were evaluated, but are not viable at this time," the EPA said in a statement explaining its move. The agency has pressed for priority Superfund status twice before based on tests that showed toxic levels of uranium produced during the processing of the copper in leach ponds had leaked into the groundwater, but backed off when state and local business leaders opposed the move for fear of a stigma that could affect property values. Gov. Brian Sandoval announced in March he was reluctantly dropping the state's opposition because the NPL listing will make $31 million available to help with the cleanup. "This public notice in the Federal Register is an anticipated next step in the process to secure federal funds to help with remediation of the Anaconda mine site," said Kay Scherer, interim director of the Nevada Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. "We are pleased to see that the site — which remains fully under control — has been recognized and included on the list of proposed national priorities, as it demonstrates that the U.S. EPA acknowledges the site is on track to proceed with corrective action," she said Thursday. The mine, which covers 6 square miles and is owned partly by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, also is polluted with arsenic, mercury and lead. Atlantic Richfield acquired the property in 1977 from Anaconda Copper, which built the mine in 1941. Fueled by demand after WWII, Anaconda produced 1.7 billion pounds of copper from 1952 to 1978. The site's most recent owner, Arimetco, abandoned it in 2000. "We have been working to address the contamination at the Anaconda mine since 2001," said Alexis Strauss, EPA's acting regional administrator for the Pacific Southwest. That's the first year the EPA first proposed priority Superfund status. Although it was kept secret at the time, tests conducted in 1976 found high uranium levels in one of the mine's evaporation ponds and additional tests in 1984 found uranium in monitoring wells at up to 40 times the level the EPA adopted for drinking water. Local activists and conservationists stepped up pressure for Superfund status in 2003 after a government contractor working with the BLM and the EPA on cleanup plans discovered documents outlining the history of the containment testing in the Anaconda archives at the University of Wyoming. BLM's Nevada Director John Ruhs said Thursday his agency "agrees with both EPA and the state that the site warrants attention."

 DALLAS (AP) — About $97 million will be spent to remove material in waste pits along the San Jacinto River east of Houston that is contaminated with toxic chemicals from a former paper mill, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday. The remediation of the Superfund site will include hauling away soil, sediment and other material from the disposal sites that were built in the 1960s and contain material contaminated with dioxins, which in people can cause cancer, reproductive problems, skin disease and changes in hormone levels. The mill was in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, and pulp and paper waste was placed on barges and then dumped along the San Jacinto. The area was deemed a Superfund site in 2008, a designation used for the nation's most contaminated land. Signs in the area caution people not to eat fish or crabs caught there. Most of the $97 million will go to efforts to clean up 14 acres just north of Interstate 10, the EPA said in a statement. Another $10 million will be spent on removals from about 20 acres south of the interstate. An estimated 152,000 cubic yards of material will be hauled away from the area north of the interstate, a volume that amounts to 140,000 tons. The EPA will accept public comments on the cleanup plan for the next two months, and Rock Owens, who heads the environmental compliance division for the Harris County attorney's office, said contractors could begin removing contaminated material in the next year or two. "It's been moving forward rather quickly, I think," Owens said of the effort since the land was given Superfund status. "Our office has been putting pressure on the EPA since Day 1 to get the stuff out of there." Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan said in a statement that the waste pits weren't discovered by government inspectors until 2005 and that they had become partially submerged in the river water. A protective cap was put in place in 2011, but not before dioxins for years had leaked into the water and riverbank, Ryan said. Problems have been found with the cap, such as a hole found in it last year that may have allowed additional dioxins to seep away. "We are very pleased that the EPA's preferred remedy ... will lead to the removal of the contaminated material from the San Jacinto River," Ryan said. Two companies, International Paper and McGinnes Industrial Maintenance Corp., a subsidiary of Waste Management, will cover the cost of the cleanup, Owens said. Tom Ryan, a spokesman for International Paper, said IP is not responsible for the waste and that the dumping occurred before it purchased the mill. "When you purchase a company you purchase the liability that comes with it," he said. IP said in a formal statement that it is evaluating the plan. McGinnes, the company that contracted with the mill's previous owner to dig the waste pits, released its own statement criticizing the EPA plan. The company argued that the better option is reinforcing the cap because excavating the site would release contaminated material along the river and put "nearby communities at risk for years to come."

 EAST CHICAGO, Ind. (AP) — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to begin removing soil this weekend from northwestern Indiana residential properties contaminated with hazardous levels of lead and arsenic. The cleanup was scheduled to start Sunday at 19 homes in an area of East Chicago where soil tested for the highest concentrations of pollutants, the Times of Northwest Indiana reported ( The work is taking place in the easternmost section of the city's Calumet neighborhood, which has been designated zone 3 of a large EPA Superfund cleanup site. The area was contaminated by smelters and other industrial sites that operated for decades. Most of the recent attention related to the contamination has focused on a public housing complex built over a former lead facility in another part of the site where hundreds of low-income residents have been abruptly ordered to leave. Children there have tested positive for high levels of lead exposure, and many residents are angry the problem was overlooked for so many years. The EPA had been planning to also start hauling away tons of soil at the West Calumet Housing Complex, zone 1 of the Superfund site. But Mayor Anthony Copeland ordered the more than 1,000 residents to move this summer and announced plans to have the 40-year-old complex demolished, forcing the EPA to put its remediation plan there on hold. The work in zone 3 is expected to take several months. The EPA said in a news release Friday that residents should expect to see heavy trucks and equipment. So far, the EPA has sampled soil at 411 properties in zone 3. Results show about 60 percent have lead or arsenic concentrations, or both, above the agency's action levels for cleanup. _ _ _ Information from: The Times,

 LAS VEGAS (AP) — Investigators say they're puzzled by a significant amount of mercury found at a Las Vegas middle school days after a few dribbles of the neurotoxin was first discovered and forced more than 1,000 students into a quarantine that lasted overnight. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that more than a quarter cup (59 milliliters) of the element has been cleaned up so far at Walter Johnson Junior High School. "It's a pretty significant amount. It's definitely more than a thermometer-worth," said EPA spokesman Rusty Harris-Bishop. "I don't know how you would get a hold of it" in that quantity. No illnesses have been reported and investigators so far have found that the overall exposure rate remains low, though the EPA said certain parts of the school, including gym and locker room areas, had mercury detected at as much as 10 to 15 times above safe levels prior to the cleanup. Classes at the school were cancelled Monday for a third day. School is expected to reopen Tuesday. High levels of exposure can cause mercury poisoning, with symptoms including muscle weakness and speech, hearing and walking impairment, according to the EPA. The Clark County School District believes a student brought in the mercury but there was no malicious intent. An investigation into how it got to the school is being led by school police. No one has come forward to acknowledge ownership or provided information about the mercury's origin. Experts said the element can be found in old thermometers and thermostats that began going out of favor decades ago, as well as through gold-mining equipment. Dr. Cathleen Clancy, associate medical director at the National Capital Poison Center, a free, nonprofit calling center, said the quarter cup of mercury found isn't an unthinkable amount and that the volume doesn't necessarily translate to inherent toxicity. "I've never been a 7th grader surfing the internet but I bet they're very, very talented," Clancy said. "I wouldn't be surprised (if) you could order it ... you can order far more poisonous things." Mercury is a naturally occurring liquid metal that is found in the environment and generally poses little risks as long as it stays in its elemental state. It can be dangerous if it is vaporized by heat, such as through the suction of a vacuum during household cleaning or evaporation over time, Clancy said. Traces of the substance also known as quicksilver likely already exist in schools, particularly in old science labs. Proper cleanup, though costly, can easily secure a campus, as spills have been reported in schools over the years with some regularity. "It's a very unusual substance. If you ever see it, you'd be very tempted to play (with) it. It's very alluring because of the way it moves around," Clancy said. The mercury was first found at the Las Vegas school Wednesday, when a group of students was seen playing with five to 10 drops of it at the gym. The hazmat situation that lasted until 5 a.m. Thursday prompted the largest decontamination effort in the history of the school district — the fifth-largest school system in the country — and Las Vegas fire department. The overnight response angered many parents who said they weren't kept informed as their children were held and criticized the school for the full-blown screening process that they didn't necessarily consent to. It took 17 hours for investigators to screen the 1,300 people at the school in potential danger of exposure. At least 50 of the 1,200 students were found contaminated and had to be cleaned that night. The EPA has so far checked 80 homes in the community among the group of students who were noted for contamination. One family has been displaced while awaiting EPA cleanup in their home, which officials pointed to as a sign that contamination isn't widespread. _ _ _ Follow Sally Ho at twitter.com/_sallyho.

 BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — A closed aluminum plant in Columbia Falls was designated by federal officials on Wednesday as an environmentally-contaminated Superfund site that needs to be cleaned up. The Environmental Protection Agency announcement will allow further investigation of the Columbia Falls Aluminum Co. to determine its risk to human health, agency officials said. The plant, located on 960 acres on the banks of the Flathead River near Glacier National Park, operated from 1955 to 2009. It's owned by Glencore, a Swiss commodities firm. The site became eligible for Superfund status after potentially hazardous materials were discovered in soil, groundwater and surface water at the plant site, and cyanide contamination was found in sediment in the Flathead River. Under Superfund designation, the EPA can require polluting companies to cover the cost of cleaning up pollution. The former aluminum plant is the 17th site in Montana to make the list, joining former mining sites, the asbestos-contaminated town of Libby and others. Glencore has owned the Columbia Falls plant since 1999 and had discussed re-opening it in recent years. The EPA began moving forward with a potential Superfund listing last year, just one day after plant managers said the closure was permanent. The plant's project manager, John Stroiazzo, said the company was disappointed by the Superfund listing but would continue to work on the site as required under an earlier agreement with the EPA. He said addressing the site through a process other than Superfund designation would have increased the chances it could be redeveloped quickly and put back into beneficial use. "Listing the site is not in the best interest of the project or the community," Stroiazzo said. U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke warned the Superfund designation will drive down area property values and hinder economic development. But U.S. Senator Jon Tester said the Superfund designation will make sure Glencore is held accountable for the cleanup after "years of broken promises and stonewalling." "Glencore can no longer try and turn their back on families in Columbia Falls," Tester said in a statement.

 DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — The federal Environmental Protection Agency plans to launch its $3.1 million cleanup of a lead-contaminated park near Dayton next spring. Tree removal at the park is expected to begin this year and soil remediation won't get underway at the 7.5-acre site in the spring of 2017. The park has been closed since last spring after the Ohio EPA detected high levels of lead in its soil. Some tests found nearly 60 times the acceptable amount. EPA officials say the agency is thinking of starting the removal of more than 6,700 tons of contaminated soil in March or April of next year.

 RULISON, Colo. (AP) — Garfield County is using microbes to help control problems associated with local oil and gas development as part of a pilot project to see if the tiny organisms can help clean soil contaminated by petroleum. Officials hope to use the treated soil to cover major waste storage areas because clean soil is hard to find in the oil and natural gas drilling areas around Rulison. County officials hope the test will be successful because it could help energy companies by eliminating the need in some cases for companies to ship contaminated soil to out-of-state facilities, including Utah. "This is a groundbreaker, and I don't mean that as a pun," Garfield Commissioner Mike Samson said. Gary Webber, vice president with Northwest Colorado Consultants Inc., an environmental and engineering firm, said state air regulators developed a cleanup standard for the new facility.

 SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — A Texas-based oil company can't use its well sites to dispose of contaminated water from oil wells until it agrees to a preliminary plan to clean up spills, the New Mexico State Land Office announced Friday. State Land Commissioner Aubrey Dunn said the agency would deny site access to Siana Operating of Midland, Texas, until the company agrees to a preliminary cleanup plan that will determine the extent of ground pollution at wells in southeastern New Mexico. Siana representatives could not immediately be reached. The State Land Office has been locked in litigation with Siana for months on accusations the company trespassed and spilled waste on state trust lands where it stopped making lease payments years ago. Dunn says Siana reached a cleanup agreement with the state Oil Conservation Division that does not address the possibility of groundwater contamination, while ignoring requirements issued by the land office. "Land Office staff developed a comprehensive site delineation plan in order to determine the extent of the environmental damage and possible groundwater contamination resulting from the company's operations," the State Land Office said in a statement. " The Land Office has not received a response from Siana regarding the agency's delineation plan, but has become aware of the fact that Siana has negotiated a significantly less extensive delineation plan with the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division." Siana has been a major provider of wastewater disposal services in New Mexico, operating two wells that injected over 13 million gallons underground in 2014, with relatively small-scale oil and natural gas extraction operations at nine wells. Wastewater from drilling operations is typically delivered by truck to disposal sites like Siana's, where most oil is skimmed off before water is injected deep underground. Oil wells in southern New Mexico also draw up salt water from an ancient, underground aquifer. The New Mexico Oil Conservation Division reached a settlement with Siana in June that provides a timeline for the company to pay a $19,000 fine and clean up spills at two clusters of wells outside Eunice, in the southeastern corner of New Mexico. The settlement agreement with the Oil Conservation Division describes how Siana for months ignored warnings from state regulators on spills and continued to operate wells after its authority was revoked. The State Land Office has said it is owed $284,000 in fees, cleanup costs and penalties.

 INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The protective cap on a decades-old landfill near an Indianapolis golf course is eroding, compromising the barrier that keeps toxins from escaping. The Indianapolis Star ( Indiana Department of Environmental Management inspectors discovered in April 2014 that the old Julietta Landfill's cap had eroded due to natural wear and tear. Officials say testing since 2014 hasn't found any imminent threat to public health. But a neighborhood group says nearby residents are concerned about what a leaking landfill could mean for them. "Just the idea of what is leeching into Buck Creek," said Jennifer Selm, the president of the Greater Troy Neighborhood Association, " it's kind of disturbing." Indy Parks planner Don Colvin says the department has been aggressively looking for solutions. The city has already spent nearly $300,000 to make repairs to the landfill. "Unfortunately, it's a side effect of owning a lot of land," Parks Director Linda Broadfoot said. "Sometimes the land has a history that predates you that has to be dealt with." The formerly private landfill was shut down in 1976 when the state board of health determined the site's geology was unsuitable for use a landfill. But starting in the early 1980's, the city used the site to store more than 16,000 tons of sludge from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The longtime industrial dumpsite was converted into the public golf course in the early 1990s.

 Caption Close MEXICO CITY (AP) — The Mexico City government declared its first air pollution alert in 11 years Monday after ozone levels reached almost twice the acceptable limit. The measure requires older and more heavily polluting vehicles to stay off the road Tuesday, in an attempt to improve air quality. The city's environment office attributed the conditions to a high-pressure system and intense sunlight. Mexico City used to regularly reach high smog levels, before a rule was introduced to discourage cars more than 8 years old. That rule was recently relaxed by a court order, and environmental activists and officials say that has led to more cars on city streets. Ozone is a component of smog that can cause respiratory problems. Mexico City's last city alert for ozone was in 2002. The last pollution alert for air particles was in 2005. Mexico City sits in a high mountain valley, where the surrounding mountains can trap pollutants and prevent them from dispersing. The city is 7,350 feet (2,240 meters) above sea level. The alert declared Monday also limits highly polluting industrial processes, and officials recommend that people stay indoors and not perform vigorous exercise outdoors.

 Caption Close The military is checking U.S. bases for potential groundwater contamination from a toxic firefighting foam, but most states so far show little inclination to examine civilian sites for the same threat. The foam was likely used around the country at certain airports, refineries and other sites where catastrophic petroleum fires were a risk, but an Associated Press survey of emergency management, environmental and health agencies in all 50 states showed most haven't tracked its use and don't even know whether it was used, where or when. Only five states — Alaska, Minnesota, New Jersey, Vermont and Wisconsin — are tracking the chemicals used in the foam and spilled from other sources through ongoing water monitoring or by looking for potentially contaminated sites. A dozen states are beginning or planning to investigate the chemicals — known as perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs — which have been linked to prostate, kidney and testicular cancer, along with other illnesses. The rest of the states, about two thirds, are waiting for the In addition to the Aqueous Film Forming Foam used in disaster pr Knowledge about the chemicals' effects has been evolving, and the EPA does not regulate them. The agency in 2009 issued guidance on the level at which they are considered harmful to health, but it was only an advisory — not a legally enforceable limit. The EPA said then that it was assessing the potential risk from short-term exposure through drinking water. It later began studying the health effects from a lifetime of exposure. Those studies remain in progress, and the agency is also considering whether to establish a firm limit on PFCs in water. The EPA required large public drinking water systems and some smaller ones to check for PFCs between 2013 and 2015. The full results have not been released because data is still being submitted, but officials in several states told the AP that PFCs were found in their water systems during those checks. Detections were reported by six Massachusetts public water systems, for example. To date, about 4,800 water systems have submitted their findings to the EPA. About 2 percent so far have reported measurable levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), or both, the agency told the AP on Thursday. None of the PFOA levels were above the EPA's guidance, the agency said, but 17 of the PFOS levels were. But beyond public drinking water, there may be contamination elsewhere that could affect private or other water supplies, including from any use of the firefighting foam. The five states forging ahead with wider tracking for PFCs are going well beyond the EPA's minimum requirement. States that are not acting point to the cost of the testing and say nothing in federal law gives them the authority to require water utilities and cities to do it routinely. "We don't have the resources to go out beyond what's required by the EPA at this point," said A few states could pinpoint situations where the foam had been used. Utah's fire marshal said the fire service there uses it sparingly and only on large flammable liquid fires, which are rare. The foam was also used at the state fire school in Delaware, but isn't anymore, according to the state emergency management agency. In Issaquah, Washington, a large amount of firefighting foam was sprayed during a tanker fire in 2002 near a well that is now contaminated, though the city said it has not confirmed the source of the pollution. The city is installing a filtration system to remove PFCs from the well water by this summer. Most states, though, said they have no way of knowing what individual fire departments are using. Last month, U.S. military officials told the AP they would check 664 sites where fire or crash training was conducted. The Navy has so far identified one site with contaminated drinking water and another with contaminated groundwater. The Army says there are low levels of PFOA in two drinking water systems. The Air Force says there are chemicals in drinking water exceeding the EPA's guidance at three bases, including the former Pease base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The Air Force has spent millions so far addressing the contamination there. PFOA was found recently in wells in Vermont, New York and New Hampshire, near where a company making Teflon has plants. Residents in Vermont raised concerns, and the state responded by testing wells and looking for contamination elsewhere, said "We're responding to some pressure to make sure we're being thorough and planning ahead, and not waiting five to 10 years to see where else PFOA could be," she said. "I think it's just a matter of time before all states are dealing with this issue." The 12 states that are beginning or planning to investigate the chemicals are California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Washington and Wyoming. Details on what the five states actively monitoring for PFCs are doing: ——— ALASKA The state is reaching out to agencies and businesses that may have used the foam and so far has found six sites with PFC groundwater contamination, including a fire training center in Fairbanks and at least two nearby private wells. ——— MINNESOTA The state's 3M Co. invented PFOA. It began to phase it out in 2002 in response to health concerns raised by the EPA, but wells near the manufacturer's disposal sites were contaminated. The state used money from a settlement agreement and consent order with 3M to sample water statewide for PFCs. State officials say they're still monitoring groundwater and evaluating clean-up options at the Duluth ——— NEW JERSEY State officials say they're focused on the ——— VERMONT The state is sampling water at sites where the chemicals were likely used, including at a fire training academy in Pittsford. The state said last week that the results at the academy showed no contamination. ——— WISCONSIN The Department of Natural Resources has sampled the groundwater at landfills for PFCs for the past eight years and plans to continue. ——— McDermott reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

 Caption Close After nearly two weeks of unhealthy air due to the tragic Camp Fire, the Bay Area will finally see some relief due to an incoming cold front that should clear some of the smoke ahead of rain Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. Though the rain is a welcome weather event, some Bay Area residents have expressed concern on social media that the rain will be "toxic," given that the air is full of smoke particles. Local meteorologists stress that there is nothing to fear. "Wind from the weather system moving in will push out most of the smoke before the rain starts," said Kristine Roselius, the Communications Manager of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Any fine particulates that remain in the air "will simply fall to the ground and incorporate into the soil," she said. <strong>ALSO READ: </strong> The smoke particles — composed largely of burnt tree matter — are carbonaceous, just like much of the matter already in the soil. It's also unlikely the particulate matter would become incorporated into the rain, even if it's highly concentrated in the air. "The scale of weather system producing rain usually precludes toxic pollution from being trapped within raindrops in California. Winds also dilute and push emission northeastward away from areas where the fires burned," the California Air Resource Board told Roselius also noted that tomorrow's precipitation is "entirely different" from acid rain, which she says is "composed of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from industrial processes that combine with water in the atmosphere." "Just be thankful the rains are finally coming," said Steve Anderson, a National Weather Service meteorologist, who echoed Roselius' sentiments.

The Camp Fire is burning near Chico more than 100 miles away from the northern most edge of the region, and while air quality is poor in the North Bay it's nowhere near what it was like during the Tubbs and Atlas fires. "In 2017, we were seeing higher impacts in the North and East Bay," says Sarah Zahedi, a spokesperson for BAAQMD. That said, if we look only at the city of San Francisco, we have seen worse daily air quality from the 2018 wildfire event compared to 2017. During the North Bay fires, the highest air quality index reading in San Francisco was a daily average of 136 on October 12. So far, during the Camp Fire, the highest reading was a daily average of 172, which falls in the "unhealthy" range on Nov. 11, 2018. Anyone who was in the city on this day remembers it well. You likely woke to eye-stinging smoke and many reported smelling it inside their homes.

  WILTON — An oil spill at a Ridgefield Road residence has contaminated at least two nearby drinking water wells and could potentially affect more households, according to officials from the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. On Sept. 7, the Wilton Fire Department was alerted by Connecticut State Police about an incident in which two residential oil tanks malfunctioned, spilling approximately 500 gallons of oil in the basement of the home at 715 Ridgefield Road. “This is one of the larger spills I’ve seen in quite a while. Five hundred gallons is a lot, especially from a home spill,” said DEEP spokesman Dennis Schain. Since the basement where the spill occurred has a dirt floor, the oil was absorbed through the dirt and seeped out of the house via cracks in the bedrock beneath the home. This is particularly concerning for DEEP, Schain said, considering that water and sewage lines don’t extend into this section of Ridgefield Road, and thus there is a high concentration of drinking water wells in the area. “Petroleum certainly can move through bedrock and its fissures, and you can’t really predict where it can come out,” Schain said. “It’s an unfortunate situation with this much fuel being released into the geology that we’re dealing with there.” Though town officials originally warned residents within 500 feet of the oil spill to check their wells for contamination, DEEP has since increased that radius to households within 1,000 feet. Schain said the department is still working to understand the extent of the oil spill. So far, at least one drinking water well, located nearby at 721 Ridgefield Road, has also been contaminated, in addition to the well at the site of the spill. To diminish further environmental impacts, DEEP has implanted three recovery wells near the site of the spill. As of Wednesday afternoon, however, the wells had collected only 75 gallons of oil. Officials also excavated the soil around the home where the incident occurred in the hopes of stemming any further spread, in addition to enlisting the services of Enviroconsultants and Recyclers, a licensed environmental company with expertise in oil spill remediation, to deal with the fallout from the spill. Those concerned that their wells may have been affected are asked to speak to the company’s representative, Robert Rein, at 203-702-8833. Further complicating matters, the spill occurred nearly two miles from the Comstock Brook, an important source of public drinking water for the area. ptomlinson@hearstmediact.com; 203-842-2570; Twitter: @Tomlinson_PE

 WILTON — It’s been more than four months since nearly 500 gallons of oil was accidentally spilled at a home on Ridgefield Road, and the effects of the spill are just now becoming clear. The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection recently released the results of a study that found only one Wilton residence above max contamination levels following the accident. The report looked at 34 different households within a 1,000-foot perimeter around 715 Ridgefield Road, where the oil spill originally occurred. The radius for testing included select homes on Ridgefield Road, Vista Road, Coachman’s Place, Carriage Road and Keelers Ridge. The results of three separate samplings done over a three-month period showed that only a single residence had been contaminated. Five homes inside of DEEP’s set perimeter declined to be tested. The residence that tested positive for contamination, 721 Ridgefield Road, is across the street from the home where the spill occurred. Residents of the home reported a strong odor of oil in their drinking water a day after the spill. While a water sample taken a couple weeks after the spill didn’t show major contamination at the residence, two samples taken in the proceeding months revealed high levels of chemicals, such as trimethylbenzenes, various xylenes and more. The study also found trace amounts of various volatile organic compounds in samples from 21 other nearby residences, though DEEP ultimately determined these water supplies were safe. “The bottom line is, with the exception of 721 Ridgefield Road, Wilton, all the reported concentrations are below Connecticut Action Levels, or Connecticut Groundwater Protection Criteria,” said Jeff Wilcox, a DEEP environmental analyst. The DEEP report concluded that the spill resulted at a pipe connecting two 240-gallon oil tanks that was sheared after one of the tank ’s legs collapsed due to rust. Since the basement where the spill occurred has a dirt floor, the oil was then absorbed through the dirt and seeped out of the house via cracks in the bedrock beneath the home. This was particularly concerning for DEEP, considering that water and sewage lines don’t extend into this section of Ridgefield Road and thus there are a high concentration of drinking water wells in the area. In the immediate aftermath of the spill, contractors installed drinking water storage tanks at the residences of 721 and 715 Ridgefield Road. Samples from the latter home later cleared the property’s drinking well of significant contamination. Contractors did, however, install a soil venting system and capped the affected basement to prevent further seepage from any unremoved oil below the home. As a result of the oil spill, DEEP officials also found a non-compliant dry well and abandoned oil tanks buried a foot beneath the surface on the property of Wilton’s Fire House 2. Subsequent testing revealed “low concentrations” of petroleum hydrocarbons, which prompted the removal of the oil tanks and surrounding impacted soil. In the wake of the spill, Health Director Barry Bogle urged residents to have their service providers complete an inspection of their oil tanks and its components. “Oftentimes these leaks or failures go undetected or are deemed to be minor or inconsequential. However, any such event may cause significant adverse effects to our natural resources. These leaks can be very difficult to remediate and can result in enormous financial expenses,” said Bogle. The homeowners of 715 Ridgefield Road accepted responsibility for all remediation and other expenses related to the spill, according to the DEEP report.

 Caption Close RIO DE JANEIRO — Rivulets of waste crisscross the labyrinth of alleyways that serve as 5-year-old Rio de Janeiro’s lack of basic sanitation is in the headlines because Olympic athletes will compete in polluted waters during next year’s Games, but it’s hardly news in areas like the Rocinha slum, where contact with untreated waste is an everyday reality for the Benjamins and tens of thousands of other families. The consequences are not fleeting — they reverberate for decades, dooming many children exposed to this filth to lives stunted by illness. One public health expert calls the sewage system in Rio largely “medieval,” comparable with London or Paris in the 14th or 15th century. And it’s not just Rio. Fewer than half of households nationwide are hooked up to sewage mains, meaning that much of the waste generated by about 100 million people runs through open-air ditches that bisect neighborhoods like Kaike’s across this continent-size nation, befouling streams and rivers that in turn contaminate lakes and lagoons, beaches and bays. From Kaike’s slum — a sprawling hillside warren of concrete and brittle brick dwellings — waste flows directly from white plastic pipes sticking out of shacks and washes downstream, partially draining into the basin that ends up in the Olympic lagoon. An independent study commissioned by Brazil is the world’s seventh-largest economy, but ranked 84th for access to water and sanitation in last year’s Yale Environmental Performance Index of 178 countries, trailing such nations such as Turkmenistan, Moldova, Albania, Syria and nearby Chile. Rapid urban growth in recent decades, poor planning, political infighting and economic instability are largely to blame, experts say.

 Across a patch of pineapples shrouded in smoke, Idris Hadrianyani battled a menace that has left his family sleepless and sick - and has wrought as much damage on the planet as has exhaust from all the The lopsided struggle is part of a battle against one of the biggest, and most overlooked, causes of global climate change: a vast and often smoldering layer of coal-black peat that has made Indonesia the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States. Unlike the noxious gases pumped into the atmosphere by gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles in the United States and smoke-belching factories in China, danger in the heart of Borneo rises from the ground itself. Peat, formed over thousands of years from decomposed trees, grass and scrub, contains gigantic quantities of carbon dioxide, which used to stay locked in the ground. It is now drying and disintegrating, as once-soggy swamps are shorn of trees and drained by canals, and when it burns, carbon dioxide gushes into the atmosphere. Each year, Indonesia loses forest area roughly the size of Connecticut. Fires, meanwhile, have grown more frequent and serious. Even when not burning, dried peat leaks a slow but steady stream of carbon dioxide and other gases. Once it catches fire, the stream becomes a torrent.

 Workers erect a large, temporary structure in hopes of containing naphthalene fumes when work resumes at the Quanta Superfund site in Edgewater. EDGEWATER — Removal of soil and debris from a tent at the Quanta Superfund site will begin this week, Environmental Protection Agency officials say. This is the next phase of the cleanup of 115 River Road — known as the Quanta site — which involves digging up contaminated soil that releases naphthalene. Naphthalene is "reasonably anticipated" to be a human carcinogen, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In studies, lab rats formed lung and nose tumors after breathing in the chemical daily. Beginning this week, Honeywell, which inherited the cleanup liability for the site, will start removing about 1,000 cubic yards of soil and debris to prepare for the soil solidification process. Solidification is used to encapsulate contaminants within soil. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong><em >Story continues below gallery</em></strong></span> A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Removing the soil and debris from the tent will allow Honeywell to reach the areas inside the tent that have not been solidified. The soil and debris will then be moved to an approved facility, the EPA said in a letter to residents. To minimize the potential release of vapors, the soil will be loaded into dump trucks while inside the tent. The beds of the dump trucks will be lined and sealed before the truck leaves the tent. The ground inside the tent will also be covered with plastic sheeting to prevent the truck tires from coming into contact with any contaminated soil. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin- right:3px;">Edgewater: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/bergen/edgewater/2019/09/18/shuttered-movie-theater-edgewater-being-torn-down/2130396001/" target="_blank">Demolition underway at former Edgewater movie theater</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">For subscribers: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/bergen/2019/10/14/bergen-county-awards-5-m-parks-contract-days-after-donation-jim-tedesco/3932999002/" target="_blank">Contract worth $5M awarded days after donation to Bergen official.

 Coal tar was manufactured at the site in the 19th century, and the EPA is now trying to clean it up. EDGEWATER — Environmental officials are alerting people near the Quanta Superfund site that they may smell naphthalene odors in coming days as soil solidification and removal is completed. Starting this week, the soil work will occur outside protective tents at 115 River Road, known as the Quanta Superfund site, Environmental Protection Agency officials said. The work will remove the remaining 10% of soil that can't be contained under a tent because of physical features that prevent setting up tents. The cleanup involves digging up contaminated soil that releases naphthalene.

 This short animation demonstrates how chemical pollution in groundwater can vaporize up into the basements of homes. From NorthJersey.com's Toxic Secrets coverage of DuPont's legacy of contamination in Pompton Lakes, N.J. HILLSDALE — A former dry cleaning business that left contaminated soil and groundwater when it shut in 1996 has been razed, and the tainted earth will soon be removed and replaced with clean fill. The building at 137 Broadway was for years home to Alexander Cleaners. The state Department of Environmental Protection With the building gone, the DEP has better access to contaminated areas. After the excavation of soil, the 0.2-acre property will be backfilled with clean fill and then paved with asphalt. The DEP said last year the soil would be removed to a depth of at least 28 feet. Chemicals from a former dry cleaner at 137 Broadway have leached into the soil and groundwater surrounding the site, and are traveling toward neighboring Bank of America. Groundwater monitoring wells are being installed at Bank of America, next door to the former dry cleaners, The agency said it intends to place a lien on the property to cover the $1.9 million cost associated with the cleanup. It anticipates remediation will take at least five years. A date for soil excavation has not been determined yet. But Fred Rubel, a member of the Hillsdale Environmental Commission, says that is not good enough. "They have to wait for money that becomes available from time to time to do the various phases of the work. We just don’t have a high degree of assurance that the work in removing the contamination will occur fairly quickly to avoid what would likely be a spread of contamination beyond what it is now," Rubel said. A map of the affected area shows levels of PCE found in soil and groundwater surrounding the 137 Broadway site of a former dry cleaner. Tetrachloroethylene — a liquid widely used for dry-cleaning fabrics and metal de-greasing — made its way into the ground beneath the building, possibly due to improper handling or disposal of the chemical, according to the DEP. The chemical is still in use by dry cleaners in New Jersey. It is considered a potential carcinogen and is regulated as a hazardous substance. The excavation will be carried out using a large diameter auger, and the contaminated soil will be disposed of off-site. "Our main concern has been that there is not too extensive a delay between the time the building has been removed and the time they remove the area of contamination, which as far as we know is pretty localized," said Rubel. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em><strong >Story continues below map</strong></em></span> He added, "if the ground is left open to rain and snowmelt that sort of thing the plumes of contamination that have pretty much been kept in place under the building could begin to migrate." Monitoring by the DEP last year indicated the contaminants were focused under the building, but that the affected groundwater was moving in the direction of the Bank of America building  Air samples from inside the bank were tested and showed no signs of the contaminants. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > Shaylah Brown is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.

 In 1872, Bergen County had just 12 townships. Before the turn of the century, there were 70 municipalities. LODI — Contaminated soil will be excavated from a cluster of borough streets in the new year, part of the ongoing cleanup work at the Maywood Superfund site. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will hold two public information sessions on Dec. 10 to detail the construction project, scheduled to begin in January 2020. The work will involve excavation of contaminated soil under portions of Branca Court, Brook Street, Columbia Lane, Garibaldi Avenue, Hancock Street, Industrial Road, Money Street, Redstone Lane and Trudy Drive. Excavation will take place only in the streets, not under homes, said Bill Kollar, community relations manager for the project. Any residential properties that were affected by contamination have already been remediated. The Maywood Superfund site stretches from Maywood to Lodi and Rochelle Park. The Maywood Chemical Works manufactured a variety of chemical products on the site beginning in 1895. From 1916 through 1955, it processed radioactive thorium and disposed of it on site in burial pits. Contaminants spread via stream runoff into Lodi and Rochelle Park, contaminating soil and groundwater, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA placed the site on the Superfund program’s National Priorities List in 1983. The US Army Corps of Engineers will host an information meeting regarding contamination cleanup in 2020 at Lodi Hose Company 2 on Dec. 10. In 2014, a $17 million remediation plan began and removed the equivalent of 450 rail cars worth of contaminated soil along with old metal drums containing the remnants of harmful solvents and degreasers. The public sessions will include an administrative update on the Superfund site as a whole. Residents can expect road detours while the work occurs. The excavated soil will be removed and hauled in covered trucks into a staging area in Maywood, which has been the normal practice during the site cleanups, Kollar said. "It's what has been going on for the last 20 years," he said. The sessions are from 1 to 4 p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. at Lodi Fire Hose Company 2. The Corps of Engineers will have representatives available to answer questions and address community concerns. Mayor Scott Luna plans to attend the afternoon session. Lodi Fire Hose Company 2, at 99 Kennedy Drive, was itself contaminated but has since been fully remediated. The adjacent Fireman's Park has also been remediated. Fireman's Park was a previously contaminated site and has been fully remediated. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">HOLIDAY: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/hudson/2019/12/03/holland-tunnel-decorations-nj/2594760001/" target="_blank">Holland Tunnel holiday decorations are up after last year's design debacle</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">CRIMINAL JUSTICE: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://www.app.com/in-depth/news/local/ public-safety/2019/12/02/crack-heroin-race-arrests-blacks-whites/2524961002/" target="_blank">An unfair system arrested millions of blacks, urged compassion for whites</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">RELIGION: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/12/02/growing-number-latinos-nj-converting-islam/2567295001/" target="_blank">Why more Latinos in the U.S. are leaving the Catholic Church for Islam</a></span> Soil samples are still being collected at 205 Main St., where a CVS store recently opened, after a cleanup there, Kollar said.

 Ridgewood Water Director Rich Calbi explains what are PFAS, how the utility tests for it and what role the substance has in our everyday lives. RIDGEWOOD — The village's water utility is suing an excavation company for allegedly dumping contaminated soil at a water supply well site in 2018, an illegal action that left the well offline for months. Ridgewood Water this week filed a complaint against Roseland-based excavation company Thomas J O'Beirne & Co., suing the company for illegal dumping of contaminated soil, trespassing and endangering public health. According to the suit, in August 2018, Ridgewood Water employees Edgar Arevalo and William Bierwas saw the excavation company dump four to six loads of dirt at Ames Well in Wyckoff, a gated property containing four water supply wells and a treatment system. The excavation company was supposed to dispose of the 14 cubic yards of soil at a site two towns away, in Oakland, according to the complaint, filed in state Superior Court in Bergen County. The village shut down the Ames Well immediately and reported the incident to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the complaint says. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin -right:3px;">Contaminants: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/environment/2020/01/23/bergen-county-drinking-water-sample-ranks-fourth-toxic-pfas-national-study-ewg-pfoa-forever-chemical/4542091002/" target="_blank">Bergen County drinking water sample ranks fourth for toxic PFAS in national study</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">‘Outrageous and shameful’: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/bergen/2019/08/16/bergen-county-fined-88-k-toxic-dumping-mahwah-nj-gun-range/2018851001/" target="_blank">Bergen fined $88K for toxic dumping at gun range.

 What are TCE and PCE solvents, and how can they affect a person's longterm health? Gov. Phil Murphy's administration has sued the owners of a former Montvale electronics plant for discharging a cancer-causing chemical that eventually contaminated nearby drinking water wells decades ago. The lawsuit filed Wednesday by state Attorney General Gurbir Grewal targets the former Handy & Harman Electronic Materials Corp. at 20 Craig Road, where high concentrations of the solvent TCE were found in the ground. State Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, here shown with Catherine McCabe, the state DEP commissioner in March 2019 when they announced earlier this year that the state filed environmental lawsuits for contamination allegedly linked to DuPont. On Dec. 18, Grewal filed a similar suit targeting the former Handy & Harman Electronic Materials Corp. in Montvale, where high concentrations of the solvent TCE were found in the ground. Several drinking water wells operated by Park Ridge were contaminated and forced to close decades ago, the lawsuit says. The state says it has spent more than $348,000 on cleanup and removal costs. The plant was owned by a number of companies that operated from 1970 to late 1985. Workers etched metal parts and did other work on electronics components that were cleaned with the degreaser TCE. The chemical was stored in tanks behind the plant. The plant shut its doors in December 1985, just two months after the TCE was discovered by the state Department of Environmental Protection, DEP records show. In 1989, 57 former employees sued the company, claiming they were exposed to the harmful chemical. TCE, or trichloroethylene, has been found in groundwater throughout New Jersey, including The chemical was used throughout the 20th century as a degreaser to clean machine parts. Long-term exposure to TCE has been shown to cause kidney cancer and lymphoma. Grewal also filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Sherwin-Williams in Camden County for contaminating ground and surface water. The natural resource damage lawsuits are the 11th and 12th filed by Grewal since last year. “Too many companies have treated the public’s natural resources like private dumping grounds, despite the health risks to our residents and the harms to our environment," he said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

 Ridgewood Water Director Rich Calbi explains what are PFAS, how the utility tests for it and what role the substance has in our everyday lives. A drinking water sample taken from a Bergen County town had one of the highest concentrations of an increasingly common group of toxic chemicals found across the nation in a survey of water systems, according to a report issued Wednesday. The blue dots show where PFAS compounds have been found in New Jersey drinking water. The sample taken in Bergenfield in August detected 12 compounds of The levels of PFAS, or polyfluoroalkyl substances, did not exceed a But the results still ranked Bergen County number four in the nationwide survey conducted by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. "It's a snapshot of what's happening locally, but it also shows the ubiquity of PFAS in our water nationally," said Sydney Evans, an analyst for the advocacy group and an author of the report. The chemicals are found in non-stick pans, polishes, waxes, paints, cleaning products and firefighting foams. Brand names that contain the chemicals include Stainmaster, Scotchgard, Teflon and Gore-Tex. PFAS compounds like PFOA, PFOS and GenX, have been found in drinking water from such upscale towns as Ridgewood in Bergen County to shore towns like Toms River to sparsely populated communities at the southwestern tip of New Jersey. They are so prevalent in New Jersey that a map accompanying the report shows New Jersey blotted out with water samples where PFAS has been detected. But that doesn't necessarily mean New Jersey is worse than any other state. "You see states like Michigan and New Jersey and think it's really bad, but those are the states that are actually looking for these chemicals," Evans said. "If other states did the same, you would have many more that would look similar to New Jersey and Michigan." Still, contamination in New Jersey is so widespread that it has prompted lawsuits by Gov. Phil Murphy's administration against the manufacturers of the chemicals. The report released Wednesday by Environmental Working Group said the number of Americans exposed to PFAS from contaminated tap water is considerably higher than previously estimated. Because PFAS chemicals don't break down easily, they can travel far distances in the air and are likely in every open-air reservoir and other surface waters used for drinking. They are nicknamed "forever chemicals" for their durability. Water samples taken across the nation showing PFAS contamination. The blue dots are drinking water samples, purple are military bases and red are other water sources. The highest sample was from Brunswick County, North Carolina, followed by the Quad Cities in Iowa, Miami and Bergen County. Suez officials said the report was highly "questionable" because it based the ranking on the sum of 12 PFAS compounds found in the sample. But the Haworth-based water company reported some similar results in its most recent The federal Environmental Protection Agency has established the health advisory levels at 70 parts per trillion. The Environmental Working Group said a safe level should be 1 part per trillion. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Lead levels: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/environment/2020/01/08/lead-levels-drop-bergen-hudson-drinking-water-suez-more-pipe-replacements-flint-newark/2831257001/" target="_blank">As lead levels fall in NJ drinking water , Suez will replace more pipes</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Did you know? : </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/new-jersey/2020/01/09/nj-lets-towns-fix-lead-tainted-water-pipes-private-property/4422925002/" target="_blank">New NJ law lets town officials go on private property to fix lead-tainted pipes</a></span> Debra Vial, a Suez spokeswoman, said the company has been testing different methods to lower PFAS compounds from its water and was leaning toward a process called anion-exchange, where contaminants are removed from water by swapping ions. "We rigorously test our water for these chemicals and we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations," she said. "But just meeting standards isn’t good enough for us – we are committed to providing our customers with the best water possible." Ridgewood spent at least $3.5 million last year to install carbon filters to deal with elevated levels of PFAS in the Ridgewood Water system, which serves 60,000 residents in Glen Rock, Midland Park, Wyckoff and Ridgewood. Rich Calbi, director of Ridgewood Water, said Wednesday that the chemical has not been detected in the water since treatment began. The village sued 3M, DuPont, Chemours, Honeywell International and other companies last year alleging they "knew or should have known" that their chemical firefighting products were soluble and "very likely to contaminate surface and groundwater," posing health risks. Soon after, New Jersey took legal action against many of the same companies for widespread contamination in almost every corner of the state. <align="left"><i><b >Reader</b> — covering our local communities takes time and resources. Support our journalism by becoming a subscriber today — </i></align="left "> In an effort to assess the extent of contamination and eventually clean up the pollution, the state Department of Environmental Protection ordered the companies in March to provide information on the discharge of PFAS through wastewater treatment plants, air emissions and sales of products containing the chemicals. A week later, the state sued the companies over contamination at several sites in New Jersey, including those contaminated with PFAS. And then in May, the state again sued the companies, alleging they knew or should have known that their flame-retardant foams sold to fire departments across New Jersey contain or break down into the toxic chemicals PFOA and PFOS.

 Aerial view of the Ringwood mines Superfund Site. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a $3.4 million plan on Thursday to reduce toxic chemicals in groundwater at the Ringwood Superfund site near the Wanaque Reservoir where Ford Motor Co. dumped industrial waste 50 years ago. But the EPA's proposal falls "This was not what the commission had originally asked for, but we're certainly going to evaluate this to see if it gets us to the same place but just in a different way," said Bill Maer, a spokesman for the commission that supplies drinking water to 2 million residents. Harmful contaminants in Ringwood's groundwater such as 1,4-dioxane But its proximity to the Wanaque Reservoir has raised concerns in recent years by some local officials, nearby residents and the commission. The EPA plans call for "in-situ treatment" at the site where wells would be drilled near the Peters Mine Pit portion of the sprawling Superfund site dotted with centuries-old iron mines. A compound would be pumped into the groundwater to help break down the contaminants. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin- right:3px;">Local: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/passaic/west-milford/2020/01/29/passaic-county-responds-outcry-ends-herbicide-use-west-milford-nj/4600524002/" target="_blank">Passaic County responds to public outcry, ends use of herbicide in West Milford</a></span > <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Environment: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/new-jersey/2019/12/30/nj-buildings-going-green-buildings-leed-program/2428282001/" target="_blank">Believe it or not, New Jersey is one of the country's leaders in 'going green.'

A second component of the plan would pump granular activated carbon and resin into an airshaft at Peters Mine Pit to treat organic contaminants in mine water. Grout would be poured in to prevent the spread of contaminated groundwater and a concrete slab would be placed over the airshaft to close it. The pollution dates back to the late 1960s when Ford contractors dumped toxic paint sludge and other waste from its former Mahwah auto plant in the forested hills of upper Ringwood next to a neighborhood where many members of the Ramapough Lenape tribe live. 1,4-dioxane was first discovered in groundwater at the site in 2015 by engineers working for Ford. A solvent used in many products, it has been known for years to cause liver and kidney damage. Several health organizations think prolonged exposure to it causes cancer. Subsequent tests over the next 18 months found high amounts of 1,4-dioxane in the groundwater and brooks that run from the Ringwood Superfund site to the Wanaque Reservoir, which sits one mile south. <align="left"><i><b >Reader</b> — covering our local communities takes time and resources. Support our journalism by becoming a subscriber today — </i></align="left "> Last year Ford's environmental contractors had pushed for natural attenuation and chemical injections to deal with the contamination. Pumping and treating the water was recommended by the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. EPA Regional Administrator Pete Lopez said his agency's plan "is the best in terms of being protective and feasible." A meeting to take public input is scheduled in two weeks. Vincent Mann, chief of the Ramapough's Turtle Clan, said the plan falls short of a complete cleanup. "The EPA is trying to push this forward to close this site," he said. "Basically it's a farce," Mann said. "It continues their actions here that basically does nothing." The plan comes six months after EPA approved It keeps 166,000 tons of contaminated soil at the O'Connor Disposal Area despite the objections of residents who live nearby, including many members of the Ramapough tribe. The chemical's discovery prompted some residents to push for a question on the 2016 municipal ballot about the cleanup, in an attempt to overturn the borough's decision on the recycling center. But a state judge ruled against supporters of the measure. EPA will hold a public meeting on Feb. 10 to discuss the cleanup plan. The meeting will be held in the Martin Ryerson Middle School at 130 Valley Road in Ringwood at 7 p.m. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > Scott Fallon covers the environment for NorthJersey.com.

 While the air pollution in the U.S. has gotten cleaner in the past decade, pollution inequity has remained high. More than 6 million pounds of toxic chemicals were released into the air and water and onto the ground in New Jersey in 2018, according to the latest federal data released Tuesday. Top polluters for North Jersey counties are listed below. Although it was a slight increase from 2017, it represented a 60% drop from a decade ago when factories, power plants, refineries and other large businesses belched 15.9 million pounds of chemicals into New Jersey's environment. “The chemical manufacturing sector in [New Jersey and New York] continues to reduce its total quantity of toxics released and this helps to protect our air, water and land for future generations," said Pete Lopez, a regional administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. While progress has been made to curb emissions, New Jersey still ranked 12 out of 56 states and territories based on total toxic releases per square mile. The pollutants reported to EPA's The EPA's data gives a partial snapshot of pollution, but doesn't include emissions like greenhouse gases and chemicals from the transportation sector that create New Jersey's smog problems.

 Hawthorne evacuated some residents along Wagaraw Rd. after an "environmental incident" Thursday afternoon, April 11, 2019. HAWTHORNE — There is no evidence of soil pollution at the site of a future rain garden where a worker accidentally punctured a buried canister containing a toxic chemical last spring, officials said. The incident, which resulted in a hazmat response, a road closing and evacuation of dozens of residents, happened at the auxiliary parking lot of Wagaraw Field in April. It delayed construction of the rain garden by almost a year. At the time of the incident, authorities reported that methyltrichlorosilane — a colorless, highly flammable liquid — seeped from the hole of the pressurized canister. Citing the municipal engineer, Borough Administrator Eric Maurer said in an email on Friday that the liquid "vaporized once in contact with the atmosphere." Part of Wagaraw Road in Hawthorne was shut down on April 11, as a result of a hazmat incident at the auxiliary parking lot of Wagaraw Field. Officials said they did not think the incident was a matter for panic, but the engineer still was asked to perform a study to make sure soil at the site was clean. "We decided to investigate further — to assure ourselves, and the public, that there was no hazard," said Mayor Richard Goldberg. A ground survey by the engineer unearthed an empty canister and scrap metal, both of which were dug up and removed. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/passaic/hawthorne/2019/12/24/dried-flower-arrangements-are-cherished-by-u-s-presidents/2633684001/" target="_blank"><strong>LOCAL: </strong> Hawthorne woman's dried flowers adored by presidents</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/passaic/hawthorne/2019/04/12/hawthorne-nj-unknown-discharge-shut-down-field-identified/3449884002/" target="_blank"><strong>RELATED: </strong>'Unknown discharge' that shut Hawthorne streets identified</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n /a" href="/story/life/food/2019/12/10/hawthorne-favorite-kirkers-inn-sold-blackjack-mulligans/4383675002/" target="_blank"><strong>CASUAL DINING: </strong>Kirker's Inn sold to Blackjack Mulligan's in Hawthorne</a></span> Soil testing detected no contamination associated with those items, officials said.

In the case of Merck, whose former land now is owned by a developer at odds with the borough over affordable housing, a $35 million cleanup of mercury-laden soil had to be conducted. The rain garden, now scheduled for completion in two months, is part of a bigger project, Gateway to the Passaic River, conceived by the Environmental Commission.

 Aerial view of the Ringwood mines Superfund Site. RINGWOOD — Residents fired a raft of criticism at a $3.4 million proposal to cap and contain toxic groundwater at the Ringwood Mines Superfund site during an EPA forum on Monday night. Though the crowd in the concrete-walled all-purpose room of the town’s middle school was small at about 50, frustrations loomed large. Vincent Mann, chief of the Ramapough Lenape’s Turtle Clan,  said many have lost faith in the process, trust in the officials who dictate progress and hope that the community in northern Ringwood will ever be free of the pollutants. “To me, this is a 56-year-old problem,” Mann said. “There’s been no change.” Arsenic-tainted soil Ford contractors stockpiled is under these tarps in an excavation site near homes on Peters Mine Road in Ringwood in this photo from the 2000s. Starting in the 1960s and continuing into the early 1970s, Ford Motor Co. dumped paint sludge and other industrial waste from its Mahwah factory in the former iron-mining region of northern Ringwood where many in Mann's clan reside. Two mine pits, Peter’s and Cannon, and a town-owned landfill called the O'Conner Disposal Area were main targets for dumping. The groundwater in and around the mines north of Margaret King Avenue is polluted with several substances including 1,4-dioxane, which is To clean it, <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em><strong >Story continues below the gallery</strong></em></span> A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. At the Peter's Mine air shaft, the EPA plans to pump in resin to capture 1,4-dioxane and activated carbon to help break down benzene before grouting and covering the shaft. Groundwater samples at the site have found 1,4-dioxane at a level 200 times above the state’s safety standard. Benzene has been detected at a level 33 times higher than the state’s groundwater standard, EPA records show. Chronic inhalation of benzene, used to make fuels, dyes, pharmaceuticals and more, can lead to blood and respiratory diseases, EPA records show. A known carcinogen, benzene can also damage the immune system and increase one’s risk of leukemia. Little is known about 1,4-dioxane. Classified by the EPA as a likely carcinogen, the chemical solvent used in cosmetics, detergents and shampoos can cause kidney and liver damage following short-term exposure, agency records show. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Treatment: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/environment/2020/01/31/epa -unveils-3-4-million-plan-clean-up-contaminated-groundwater-ringwood-ramapough-wanaque-reservoir/2856737001/" target="_blank">EPA unveils $3.4M plan to treat toxic groundwater near Wanaque Reservoir in Ringwood</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Archive: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/passaic/ringwood/2017/04/06/ringwood-progressing-superfund-cap-recycling-center/100091948/" target="_blank">Ringwood proceeds with Superfund site recycling center</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin- right:3px;">Local: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/passaic/ringwood/2020/02/10/ringwood-nj-police-shoot-kill-pit-bull-during-traffic-stop/4714471002/" target="_blank">Ringwood cops shot and killed dog that charged at them during traffic stop, officials say</a></span> Moreover, a wall of wells would be drilled downgrade of the Peter’s Mine Pit, just north of the O’Connor Disposal Area, and filled with a compound designed to break down contaminants in migrating groundwater, Gowers said. Jeff Tittel of the New Jersey Sierra Club, a third-generation landowner in Ringwood, likened the plan to putting “a Band-Aid on a bullet hole.” Tim Eustace, the executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission, which operates the nearby Wanaque Reservoir, said in an interview prior to the meeting that the EPA’s plan fell short of what the commission had wanted to ensure the reservoir is protected. <align="left"><i><b >Reader</b> — covering our local communities takes time and resources. Support our journalism by becoming a subscriber today — </i></align="left "> The reservoir has never tested positive for 1,4-dioxane, a likely carcinogen, due to dilution. The commission was nonetheless pushing for a pump and treat system that would siphon the contaminated water to the surface to remove the pollution. “We want to get [the pollution] out of here, and we felt this was the best way to do that,” Eustace said. “It’s also a much more expensive process, which may be why EPA didn’t consider it.” The parties responsible for the pollution — Ford and the Borough of Ringwood — are on the hook to pay for the cleanup. The EPA does not believe the pump and treat plan is required, Gowers said. Above-ground treatment would likely use similar materials and require a massive amount of pumping, he said. The Peter's Mine air shaft is estimated to hold 213 million gallons of water. Without a plan to fully remove contaminants from the site, the relocation of the area’s residents should be a consideration, said Michael Edelstein, a Ramapo College environmental professor who has closely monitored the situation in Ringwood for years. The pond of the Peter's Mine pit as seen on March 20, 2013. Work is expected to begin at this off-limits cleanup site at the end of Peters Mine Road in Ringwood in 2019. The sinkhole-prone mining area would be a problem even if it was contaminant-free, he said. Pat Seppi, the EPA’s community coordinator, said relocation programs are reserved for sites when there are no feasible cleanup options. “We feel that we can clean it up effectively and responsibly without moving people out,” she said. Town resident Peter Sando said he believes the community input — dominated by calls for a more thorough cleanup — will continue to be ignored. The site has been a known contamination zone by the EPA for more than 30 years, with arsenic, lead, benzene and 1,4-dioxane present on site. After a while, the fight becomes futile, Sando said. EPA officials said they will continue to solicit comments from the public before confirming the plans for the site in an official record of decision. Comments on the EPA’s recommended plans for the Ringwood Mines groundwater can be submitted through March 2 to Gowers' email at gowers.joe@epa.gov. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > David Zimmer is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.

 WASHTENAW COUNTY. , MI -- A broken force main pipe on Bunton Road caused about 50 gallons of sewage to overflow in Augusta Township on New Year ’s Eve, the line’s owner announced Thursday. F&V Operations and Resource Management said on Jan. 2 that the old pipe had reached the end of its longevity and caused a 2-foot-by-2-foot sink hole south of Bemis Road, group manager Blair Selover said. The sink hole contained the raw wastewater and there is no public health concern. The spill was west of the road on the green way, Selover said. None of the spill impacted surface waters, according to a news release. The concrete pipe, which leads to the Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority treatment plant, was replaced with plastic within 24 hours. <b>MORE ON MLIVE:</b> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/01/deer-cull-returns-historic-look-at-michigan-union-top-ann-arbor-headlines-dec-29-jan-3.html" target="_blank">Deer cull returns, historic look at Michigan Union : Top Ann Arbor headlines Dec. 29-Jan. 3</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/2020/01/michigan-alabama-draws-huge-rating-for-abc.html" target="_blank">Michigan-Alabama draws huge rating for ABC</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2020/01/yes-the-michigan-attorney-general-really-wants-to-know-every-time- you-get-a-robocall.html" target="_blank">Yes, the Michigan Attorney General really wants to know every time you get a robocall</a > <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/01/12-gallon-sewage-overflow-reported-at-ypsilanti-township-treatment-plant.html" target="_blank">12-gallon sewage overflow reported at Ypsilanti Township treatment plant</a>

 KALAMAZOO, MI — The city of Kalamazoo is working to inspect sewage pipes after a second sewer leak was discovered, sending an estimated 2,370 gallons of sewage into a storm pipe and, ultimately, flowing into the Kalamazoo River. City crews discovered a sewage leak and responded about 5:40 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 17, at a storm sewer at Cameron Street and Washington Avenue, the city said in a news release. The release triggered a “no body contact” order for a section of the Kalamazoo River between the Kings Highway and Mills Street bridges, which remained in place Thursday morning. Earlier, on Sept. 9, a sewage leak was found going into a storm pipe and to the river. The city estimated 94,500 gallons of sewage entered the river after it was reported and before the leak was repaired. The pipe was leaking for an unknown amount of time before it was discovered, the city said. A fisherman spotted the outflow. <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2019/09/fisherman-saw-sewage-in-kalamazoo-river-coming-from-pipe-cut-a-long-time-ago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Fisherman saw sewage in Kalamazoo River coming from pipe cut a ‘long time ago’</a> <a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/2019/09/fisherman-saw-sewage-in-kalamazoo-river-coming-from-pipe-cut-a-long-time-ago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The pipe was fixed Tuesday evening.</a> The Sept. 9 leak, reported at Washington and Stockbridge, is about a block away from the location of the Sept. 17 leak, Public Services Director James Baker said. City crews found softball-sized holes in the pipe on Sept. 17, Baker said. He said city crews do not know how long those holes have been there. Baker said it appears sections of the city’s Edison neighborhood had a combined storm and sanitary sewer system at one time and were later separated. In the area where the leaks occurred, the smaller sanitary sewer pipe found to be leaking is located inside the larger storm sewer pipe. City workers will clean the pipes and use a camera to check for any other leaks or issues, Baker said. “We’re doing a full-court press in the area,” Baker said. “We’re looking at all the sewers from Lake Street south to Lay Boulevard." City crews and contractors are doing the work to make sure any issues can be found and fixed, Baker said. Residents may see city workers and contractors going into manholes in the area, he said. There will be some local traffic control in the area for the work, he said.

 FLINT, MI -- A section of sewer at a former General Motors Corp. factory site that is contributing to the release RACER, the company that took over the Buick City site in Flint site after GM went bankrupt, spoke about this plan and further testing of the site at public bus tour and meeting Tuesday, Aug. 13. So far, the hunt for PFAS on the 413-acre former Buick City property on Flint’s north side has found the chemicals in groundwater, storm sewers and sanitary sewers. <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/pfas-testing-at-ex-buick-city-site-expands-amid-effort-to-reduce-flow-into-flint-river.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PFAS testing at ex- Buick City site expands amid effort to reduce flow into Flint River</a> <a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/08/pfas-testing-at-ex-buick-city-site-expands-amid-effort-to-reduce-flow-into-flint-river.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">More testing is needed to pinpoint sources of chemicals, says RACER Trust.</a> Nine of 13 storm sewer outfalls show readings of a combination of PFOA and PFOS, the types of PFAS regulated in surface water, according to the most recent results updates from Tuesday, Aug. 6. For one of the sites, RACER will abandon a section of the sewer where PFAS is leaking, Grant Trigger, Michigan cleanup manager for RACER Trust, said at the meeting. The section will be closed off and a new sewer will be built with sealed joints that are leak-proof. “We have a high expectation that that’s going to solve the problem in this area," he said. The plan has been sent to city council for review and RACER Trust will be working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the project, he said. An additional meeting will be held in the Fall to field community input on steps moving forward. PFAS was While all of the locations are downstream of the Flint water plant’s water intake, used several years ago, and did not affect the city’s drinking water, the PFAS amounts are higher than the state allows to reach Michigan’s surface water. The chemicals are connected to cancer and several other adverse health effects, and the state is midway through a plan to regulate them in drinking water. This is the fourth meeting held to address contamination since the site ceased factory operations, and RACER acquired it and other unused GM properties during the bankruptcy and GM reorganization. “The biggest impact of the bankruptcy was felt in Michigan and this community,” Trigger said. “I’m a native of Michigan, I took this job with enthusiasm to help people hurt by the bankruptcy,” Trigger said during a bus tour held to show residents the scale of the site before the meeting. RACER is charged with cleaning up and finding new uses for the property, and it’s been listed for sale for several years. About 49 acres have been sold, and other pending deals were put on hold while the PFAS situation unfolded. RACER is working with state and federal regulatory agencies clean up acquired property. The RACER Trust was provided with nearly $500 million to conduct these investigations and cleanups across all RACER-owned sites. The GM Buick City site was granted $35 million of the trust and there is around $25 million left, he said. The discovery of PFAS on the former manufacturing site is the largest challenge facing the trust, Trigger said. In the past 10 months alone, RACER has spent around $1 million to spearhead cleanup. “Much of the work that we’re doing is ongoing, and we’d like to share the results with you on our way,” he said during the meeting. < a href="https://www.michigan.gov/pfasresponse/0,9038,7-365-86510_88060_88065-476513--,00.html">Other Flint-area sites</a> Long-time Flint resident Dennis Sykes said curiosity is what brought him to the meeting Tuesday. “I feel like at least RACER is trying to be transparent about what they are doing on the property now, but it still leaves a lot of questions about what was done on the property prior to RACER owning it and no one being held accountable,” Sykes said. Transparency over state and national government oversight of contamination in past years has not been what it should be, he said. “The whole thing just seems foul to me,” Sykes said.

The Lapeer Police Department asked for a voluntary evacuation of residents and business owners between the intersections of Nepessing and Saginaw streets to Nepessing and Mason streets. The incident began around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, May 29 when Lapeer police responded to the downtown area for a noise complaint. They discovered gasoline from an unknown source had entered the sewer lines, causing a “disruption” that led to several manhole covers being dislodged, according to police. As of 11 a.m., Lapeer police Chief Dave Frisch said authorities were actively working the scene with assistance from Lapeer Fire & Rescue and the city’s Department of Public Works. “Should there be some type of a spark or something of that nature with the fumes concentration that we have there it could be very serious," he said.

Normally the decision to evacuate the building would come from the county administrator or chief judge, Wise said, and he hasn’t heard from either of them. Mark Capstick, manager of Lynch and Sons Funeral Directors, said he received a call at 6 a.m. Wednesday morning about the leak from an employee who also serves as a volunteer firefighter. “He said when I get a chance I’ll come down and check your basement, but if you beat me to it, check your basement. We don’t think it’s gone down as far as the funeral home," said Capstick, who purchased the funeral home in 2004 along with wife Katie. “We’re kind of right at that cutoff line. I just flew in here this morning, and checked it and we are in good shape. No gas smell, no issues ..." Frisch didn’t know how long the closure would last as of Wednesday morning. “We’re still in the control mode,” he said “We don’t know the extent of the amount of spillage.” He noted there is a “very, very large concentration of gasoline” to the south of Nepessing Street in a lift station, also referred to as a pump house. “That is where the private contractors are focusing their efforts on,” said Frisch. “We believe if we get it controlled there, we can stop anymore from getting into the sewer line.” When asked about the potential for additional evacuation orders, Frisch said, “ There’s always that possibility," adding, “We feel confident that the evacuations we have in place are meeting the needs of the situation as it’s presenting itself right now.” He thanked homeowners and businesses for their cooperation, as well as asking them to remain diligent and feel free to speak up if they observe anything out of the ordinary. “If you smell gasoline in your home, definitely contact us,” Frisch said. Officials were looking at diagrams in an effort to assess where the flow of gasoline may go, but Frisch said “you never know for sure.” “Our best source would be that homeowner or that business owner making us aware of it,” he said. <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/05/gasoline-in-sewer-lines-closes-downtown-lapeer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gasoline in sewer lines closes downtown Lapeer</a> <a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2019/05/gasoline-in-sewer-lines-closes-downtown-lapeer.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The gasoline's source is unknown.</a>

 KALAMAZOO, MI -- Fumes from a punctured barrel containing a chemical led to two people being treated for exposure in Kalamazoo, police said. Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety officers responded about 10 a.m. Friday, June 7 to 3600 Alvan Road on a report of a 55-gallon drum that had been punctured inside of a trailer. The drum was leaking trimethyl phosphate. The chemical is used as a gasoline additive to prevent spark plug fouling and engine rumble, a flame retardant for paints and polymers and a raw material for making insecticides, according to the U.S. National LIbrary of Medicine. The Kalamazoo County Hazmat team responded and the leak was contained, but about half the liquid had escaped the barrel. Windy conditions caused fumes to be blown toward a nearby business. The business was evacuated but two people were taken to a hospital for treatment of minor issues related to exposure to the fumes.

 <i>Update, 8:44 p.m. Jan. 28: < /i> MUSKEGON TWP., MI – A sewage spill next to Baker College near Muskegon dumped as much as 132,000 gallons of untreated wastewater into a nearby storm sewer and creek on Tuesday. The leak in a sewer force main was discovered around 9:30 a.m. Jan. 28 on Quarterline Road south of Marquette Avenue in front of Baker College in Muskegon Township, said Dave Johnson, director of the Muskegon County Wastewater Management System. The sewage entered a storm drain that dumps into Four Mile Creek, which runs through the campus of nearby Muskegon Community College, Johnson said. The creek was being tested for the presence of E. coli, and a no-contact advisory was expected to be issued, he said. Municipal workers realized that wastewater was seeping out of a crack in the roadway and Johnson was notified around 10 a.m., he said. The wastewater flowed from the crack – created when the leak lifted up the force main and pavement -- into the nearby storm drain and did not pool on any property, Johnson said. Further investigation revealed the leak was on the bottom of the pipe, leading officials to pull back somewhat on the initial estimate that 132,500 gallons spilled, Johnson said. He called that estimate very conservative. Jackson-Merkey Contractors were called in to repair the pipe and roadway. The flow was stopped at 12:05 p.m., though more untreated wastewater spilled from 12:35 p.m. to 1:11 p.m. as workers had to add an additional pump to transfer sewage from a lift station wet well into a tanker, Johnson said. <i>Also on MLive:</i> < a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/2020/01/soon-to-be-vacant-hackley-building-could-become-muskegon-county-offices.html">Soon-to-be-vacant Hackley building could become Muskegon County offices</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/2020/01/food-processing-incubator-to-be-built-at-muskegon-community-college.html">Food processing incubator to be built at Muskegon Community College</a> <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/muskegon/2020/01/three-more-marijuana-dispensaries-get-ok-in-muskegon-township.html">Three more marijuana dispensaries get OK in Muskegon Township</a>

 COVERT, MI -- There is no threat to the public after a leak occurred at the The plant was shut down Saturday, Oct. 13, after radioactive water leaked through a control rod seal, Palisades' Resident Inspector Julie Beottcher said. The leak never reached outside the plant barriers and was held inside the containment area, she said. The plant was closed Saturday while the leakage was repaired, but remains closed for a failed transformer. When plant operators were preparing to restart the plant Monday, a transformer failed. The transformer is used to reduce voltage to levels that can be used by plant equipment. The plant remains shut down awaiting repairs of the transformer. The power plant was introduced to the region in the late 1960s.

 HEMLOCK, MI - Emergency crews stopped a leak at the Hemlock Semiconductor Operations facility on Wednesday, Sept. 5, but not before it released a cloud of chemical into the air above the plant. "We were dispatched at 9:54 a.m. this morning, there was a chemical leak at Hemlock Semiconductor," Thomas Township Fire Chief Mike Cousins said. "It didn't leave the property. It was visible, however." The cause of the leak is under investigation and no injuries were reported. Rachel Swanson, a spokeswoman for Hemlock Semiconductor, wrote in an email the site had a release of chlorosilanes that created a "visible, fog-like cloud" but the event was contained to the company's property and there was no community impact. She added that the chemical is colorless, but if released into the atmosphere, it may form a visible cloud. She also wrote via email that emergency response protocols were activated and local emergency crews came onsite as backup. Cousins said the chemical is an irritant if it gets in contact with humans. Hemlock Semiconductor makes polycrystalline silicon at its Saginaw County facility  for the semiconductor and solar cell industries.

 Whitingspill.jpg Cleanup crews deploy boom along the Lake Michigan shoreline near the BP Whiting Refinery in Whiting, Ind., March 25, to recover crude oil discharged from the refinery. < em>(U.S. Coast Guard)</em> Pollution response teams discuss cleanup plans along the Lake Michigan shoreline near the BP Whiting Refinery in Whiting, Ind., on Wednesday, March 26. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> WHITING, IN -- A BP incident management team said an initial visual estimate showed between 377 and 755 gallons of crude oil spilled into Lake Michigan when a A cleanup team of eight people returned to the shore of BP's Whiting Refinery for three hours Wednesday, March 26. The crew observed "minimal" oiling along the shoreline, according to a Coast Guard release. More oil was manually cleaned from the shoreline after crews removed 1 centimeter tarballs from the sand on Tuesday. The company notified the Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana Department of Environmental Management after discovering the spill late Monday afternoon. It's believed a malfunction occurred with a crude oil distillation unit, sending oil into the refinery's cooling water outfall and into the lake. BP representatives said crews have recovered the majority of oil that was visible in the cove-like area along the shoreline between the refinery and a nearby steel mill. Booms and vacuum trucks were used to contain and remove surface oil. Crews also manually collected oil that was pushed to shore by wind. A view from a Coast Guard helicopter Tuesday showed the spill appeared to be contained to the cove area on BP property. Coast Guard representatives said BP's team will continue engineering analyses to determine the exact amount of oil discharged. A spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management on Tuesday said the environmental impact appeared minimal and there were no indications that drinking water was threatened. Philip Willink, senior biologist with Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, said Lake Michigan wildlife should not suffer any long-term effects based on information released by BP and the federal agencies handling the spill. Prolonged ice cover on the lake kept many native fish species off-shore, he said. "Right now the fish are still in deeper water and haven't come back in yet," Willink said. "I think BP kind of got lucky with their timing. If it happened earlier, if (Lake Michigan) was still ice-covered, it probably would have been hard to do something about." Fish typically return closer to shore in April, Willink said. Very low levels of petroleum can impact fish and other wildlife, causing birth defects. Willink said the spill sounds minor, but wildlife and environmental experts hope preventative measures are taken. "Everybody's looking very closely at this," he said. <em >Angie Jackson covers public safety and breaking news for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.

 GRAND RAPIDS, MI — A medical device manufacturer is facing $110,000 in fines related to emissions of a cancer-causing chemical from a sterilization facility near downtown.

 The thick white foam pouring through a ravine and rolling over a roadway near an I-75 interchange in southwest Detroit seemed scary and mysterious Police were called, Hazmat crews wore gloves and boots to get samples, and Schaefer Highway was closed for the so-called “foam events” over several days in early August. By the time the foam dwindled to a trickle then stopped, the public was told it wasn’t harmful. Officials said the oozing river of foam it may have resulted from construction of a parking lot near Schaefer Highway and I-75 in Melvindale. Neither was true, investigators now say. Laboratory tests confirm extremely high concentrations of The investigation trail started with Norfolk Southern Railroad, then went to Marathon Petroleum, which operates the state’s only refinery. Both received violation notices at year-end, but neither appears to be the source. The mystery may be publicly solved this month. “We think we’ve got a line on it,” said Stephen Kuplicki of the industrial waste control division of the Great Lakes Water Authority. “We’ve laid out several possible enforcement actions.” Clues point to the use of AFFF, or That conclusion is the result of an environmental “whodunit” investigation by the state’s largest water authority. The situation attracted local attention, but it also reflects growing concerns about PFAS contamination and the chemicals’ health effects on state residents.

Whitmer orders expedited draft rules to limit toxic fluorochemicals called PFAS in public drinking water.</a> While the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy oversees statewide PFAS detection and enforcement, GLWA is investigating the Melvindale mystery foam because it discharged into its storm sewer system. Water moves from the storm sewers to the waste water treatment plant that the water authority runs for communities across southeast Michigan. That wastewater treatment plant, in turn, discharges to the Detroit River, which is both a drinking water source for Metro Detroit and connected to the Great Lakes. Wastewater processes target biological waste, but they don’t filter for PFAS – the per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals linked to cancer and other adverse health effects. <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2018/11/businesses_discharging_pfas_in.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Businesses discharging PFAS into Michigan's waterways</a> < a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2018/11/businesses_discharging_pfas_in.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MLive investigation shows high levels of toxic chemicals are flowing through wastewater treatment plants, violating state law while threatening the environment and public health.</a > The state regulates the presence of two types of PFAS in surface water used for drinking water, keeping PFOS below 11-parts per trillion and PFOA below 420-ppt. Because the PFAS foam was moving through the wastewater plant, it became responsible to investigate the source – and halt it. Within a week of the so-called “foam event,” state officials said it appeared to be the result of a solvent put onto Norfolk Southern property where the railroad had just established a 25-acre asphalt parking lot and foam was found churning in a catch basin. They took tests, and reports indicated they didn’t expect it to be hazardous. But in the meantime, it prompted the railroad to bring a vacuum truck to the property during rain storms “to intercept the foam leaving the sewer and entering Schaefer Highway,” according to the state. But while the railroad was forming a mitigation plan to bring an end to the foam, officials determined that no asphalt mixture would contain PFAS. And the railroad traced the foam to “a previously unknown storm sewer pipe from the property to the west owned by Marathon Petroleum.” So the trail turned to the state’s only oil refinery, which operates in southwest Detroit. Marathon already had been working with GLWA on reducing the PFOS it was sending into the wastewater treatment plant, with the concentration ranging from 210-ppt to 800-ppt through July 2018 – and as low as 100-ppt since then. That PFAS comes from AFFF chemicals used by Marathon’s on-site firefighters, the company says. In the meantime, the PFAS tests came back on the foam: It tested at a highly concentrated 729,000-ppt of PFOS and 9,000-ppt of PFOA. The numbers were far higher than what previous was found at Marathon. Both Norfolk Southern and Marathon Petroleum received violation notices from GLWA due to the mystery foam and they continue to work on decontaminating the area, officials said. “That enforcement with both of them is still open and active,” Kuplicki said. But neither now is believed to be the cause of the foam. Now GLWA is looking at fire-fighting foam as the cause and it may be from a municipal source. <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/03/pfas-pollution-already-costing-michigan-communities-millions-of-dollars.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PFAS pollution already costing Michigan communities millions of dollars</a> <a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/03/pfas-pollution-already-costing-michigan-communities-millions-of-dollars.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michigan residents may be in line to pay for the fixes to PFAS contamination for years to come.</a> Marathon said its investigation also points to AFFF from off-site, with a company representative the foam was used by a municipality at a scrap yard fire in June 2018, and it and traveled through a storm water ditch, eventually reaching Schaefer Highway. Chief Joseph Murray, who runs the consolidated Dearborn and Melvindale Fire Departments, said his department does not stock AFFF that contains PFAS. GLWA’s Kuplicki said he expects more information later this month as officials there determine who else may be involved. “Everybody’s on the table,” he said. Meanwhile, the state is still waiting for its comprehensive plan on how to deal with AFFF. The state fire marshal toured several Michigan departments in fall 2018 as officials inventoried how much foam containing PFOS still could be in use. State officials provided no information on where that effort stands today. And the situation on Schaefer Highway elevated the AFFF issue with PFOS across Marathon Petroleum. While the foam may be essential for certain times of fires, the company is changing its policy in Detroit – and maybe elsewhere. “Marathon has stopped using C8 firefighting foam in Detroit’s emergency response vehicles and in any fire training exercises, said spokesman Jamal Kheiry. “We are evaluating our emergency response activities company-wide.” <a class="enhanced-link__headline-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/04/ michigan-sets-new-health-screening-limits-for-5-types-of-pfas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michigan sets new health screening limits for 5 types of PFAS</a> <a class="enhanced-link__description-link" data-enhanced="true" data-thumbnail="true" href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/04/ michigan-sets-new-health-screening-limits-for-5-types-of-pfas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The move sets a significantly lower base-line for considering potential health effects for people exposed to the chemicals.</a>
