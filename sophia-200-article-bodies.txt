A chemical spill at Ben Taub Hospital drew hazmat crews to the Texas Medical Center Sunday morning. One person was treated for chemical exposure after a leak detected around 9:20 a.m. sparked a small-scale evacuation. It was not clear whether a patient or worker was contaminated in the spill, but HFD spokeswoman Sheldra Brigham said it was not a firefighter. The leaked chemical was not immediately identified, and crews were still on scene as of 11 a.m.

SIKACHI-ALYAN, RUSSIA - Yevgenia Osadchaya is beside herself with worry, wondering how her family will survive when the toxic slick flowing from China pollutes the Amur River that provides the livelihood for her family and her native Nanai people. "Not eat fish for a whole year?" cried the 47-year-old, legally blind with cataracts. "How will our nation, the Nanai, live? We'll all die." The native peoples of Russia's Far East, many of whom rely on the Amur for food and income, are among those most endangered by the imminent arrival of 100 tons of benzene released into a tributary upriver after a deadly Chinese chemical plant explosion Nov. 13. The spill prompted Chinese authorities to shut down the water supply for Harbin, a northeast city of 3.8 million people, for five days. A second city — Jiamusi, which has about 500,000 people — also shut down a water plant on the Songhua River, fearing contamination, officials said Saturday. Russian authorities expect the slick to cross the border Dec. 10 or 11, and three days later reach the regional capital Khabarovsk. Restrictions on eating Amur fish could last a year or even several, as chemicals linger in the winter ice and riverbed, experts say. The native people "live from fish. But trading in fish will likely be banned," said Natalya Zimina , spokeswoman for the Khabarovsk regional government. She said authorities would strive to inform villagers that eating the affected fish is even worse than drinking the water. Nearly 11,000 Nanai people live in the Khabarovsk region, comprising the largest native group here, according to the 2002 Russian census. Other minorities include the Evenki with 4,500 people, Ulchi at 2,700 and Nivchi at 2,500. Many of the Nanai, who retain their own language, are fishermen whose eastern Siberian ancestors once made clothes from scaly fish skins and who still make shoes from fish. Samples of the skins are shown at the village museum in Sikachi-Alyan, 37 miles downriver from Khabarovsk. Svetlana Oninka, a history teacher who runs the village's one-room museum, noted the importance that fish plays in traditional Nanai dishes, sometimes consumed raw. "Now there won't be fish — not boiled, fried and definitely not raw," she said. Nina Druzhinina , head of the village administration, said residents already have been warned not to drink Amur water or eat fish. The spill is just the latest example of civilization impinging on traditional customs here, she said. "It's hard to have a traditional life when you have legislation," she said, naming fishing and hunting quotas. The Nanai are already also coping with years of industrial pollution by chemicals such as phenol, which affects Amur fish in the winter, giving it a chemical smell. At least this village of 314 Nanai residents has another way besides fish to support itself. Stone carvings dating from 14,000 years ago are a steady draw for thousands of visitors a year. Residents make small fur-lined talismans with traditional symbols for health and long life, or small figures in native dress, to sell to tourists for $1.75 each. Still, Osadchaya worried that even that small trade could be devastated by the chemical spill. To supplement a pension she says is not enough to support her family, her daughter makes the souvenirs, and her sons go fishing. "If the spill arrives, then no one will come here," she said.

Connecticut Fund for the Environment and its bi-state program Save the Sound has filed with the United States Environmental Protection Agency in Boston a Request to Modify, Revoke and Reissue or Terminate two permits that allow the Springfield Water and Sewer Commission to discharge treated and raw sewage into the Connecticut River. The municipal wastewater discharged by Springfield adds 2,341 pounds of nitrogen per day into the Connecticut River, which ultimately impacts the health and environment of Long Island Sound. “For decades, the EPA, the authority that issues discharge permits in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has allowed Springfield to continue discharging raw sewage from 23 different locations during wet weather. Bacteria and nitrogen pollution from these discharges flow down the Connecticut River and into Long Island Sound. This is unacceptable,” said CFE/Save the Sound Staff Attorney Jack Looney. Excess nitrogen fuels algae growth that sucks oxygen from the Sound’s waters, causing dead zones each summer. Additionally, there is increasingly strong evidence that nitrogen pollution is a major cause of the coastal marsh degradation that exposes shoreline communities in Connecticut and New York to punishing storm waves. CFE/Save the Sound’s request highlights three problems with the permits. The treated wastewater permit for the wastewater treatment facility on Bondi Island, in Springfield, Mass., fails to incorporate a legally enforceable nitrogen limit, a measure required by Connecticut’s Water Quality Standards for aquatic life in Long Island Sound. The second permit allows large amounts of raw sewage from Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) outfalls to be discharged into the Connecticut River, which impacts the water quality in the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound. (For example, Hartford’s Metropolitan District Commission is required to reduce its CSOs to zero, while the EPA has allowed Springfield’s 23 discharges to continue.) The Springfield wastewater treatment facility’s permit was last issued in 2001. Since then, it has been improperly administratively continued, which has prevented public comment and participation. Because of this, critical information about the impact of Springfield’s wastewater plants on the health and environment of Long Island Sound has not been considered. CFE/Save the Sound argues that proper public notice and participation would have resulted in lower nitrogen limits and fewer sewage overflows. In February 2015, CFE/Save the Sound filed a petition demanding EPA take legally enforceable steps to reduce nitrogen discharges into Long Island Sound. Despite reductions that have been required since 2000, primarily in Connecticut and New York, the Sound continues to struggle with nitrogen-induced conditions such as dead zones, fish kills and toxic algae. In December 2015, EPA released a strategy to address these conditions. The strategy highlights reducing nitrogen discharges into the Connecticut River as a priority. As a result, CFE/Save the Sound is holding its petition in abeyance, pending the results of the EPA nitrogen strategy. Roger Reynolds, legal director for CFE/Save the Sound, said, “We put our petition aside for now and we are working with EPA to implement their wide ranging nitrogen strategy. In the meantime, however, EPA must hold Massachusetts plants to the same legal requirements they’ve held Connecticut and New York to. Nitrogen and raw sewage from the Springfield plant is polluting the Connecticut River and Long Island Sound, imperiling human health and harming aquatic life. The fact that the plant is located in Massachusetts does not entitle it to a free ride.” “The EPA should set an example as well as standards,” said Margaret Miner, executive director of Rivers Alliance of CT. “Unlike the situation in Connecticut, where the state has authority to administer Clean Water Act programs, in Massachusetts the EPA is directly in charge of sewage treatment operations. To be consistent with its own standards, EPA should require the notorious Springfield facility to clean up and quit polluting the Connecticut River, which runs all the way from Springfield through Connecticut and into Long Island Sound. We look forward to welcoming clean water coming out of Springfield.” “Long Island Sound supports an economy that transcends state borders, and protecting it should be a shared responsibility,” said Louis Burch of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. “When the State of Massachusetts’ wastewater is having an obvious impact on our Sound, common sense dictates that EPA should be holding them to the same strong water quality standards as New York and Connecticut. It’s the neighborly thing to do.”
