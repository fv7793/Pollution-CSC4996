 <p>ROBINSON TWP. — Results of a second sampling for PFAS at Robinson Elementary School, released Wednesday, confirmed levels of contamination above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifetime health advisory limit.</p> ROBINSON TWP. — Results of a second sampling for PFAS at Robinson Elementary School, released Wednesday, confirmed levels of contamination above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lifetime health advisory limit. A combined 119 parts per trillion (ppt) of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were detected in a follow-up sampling effort after a combined 110 ppt in the school’s drinking water from a well was announced Monday. A total of 171 ppt was detected in the new sampling conducted Tuesday — higher than the 144 total ppt initially detected. The EPA’s limit that touches off a health advisory is 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS combined. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, in conjunction with the Ottawa County Department of Public Health, plans to sample 25 properties in the northeast vicinity of the school, which officials determined was the direction of groundwater flow. Sampling conducted at nearby Little Hands Daycare and the Robinson Township Fire Department were below the EPA limit. A combined level of 4 ppt PFOA and PFOS was detected at the day care, with a total PFAS level of 32 ppt. The combined level at the fire department was 5 ppt and 7 total PFAS. The source of the contamination is being investigated. Emily Stef has lived in Robinson Township — about 2 miles from Robinson Elementary School — since 2003. Her two sons, Henry and Theo, attend the school and, when Stef was made aware of the contamination of the school ’s water Monday, the family immediately stocked up on bottled water and stopped drinking from the tap at their home. Stef was well aware of the impacts of PFAS contamination at sites across Michigan. She and her family travel to Rockford regularly to go fishing, and when high levels of PFAS were discovered in that area in 2017, they stopped drinking the water at restaurants. At home, Stef said she has had her own well water tested multiple times for other chemicals, but PFAS is new on many people's radars. “You’re blindsided by this,” she said. “You don’t think it’s going to happen here, but, when it does, you’re shocked and scared.” Stef said she was happy with the school’s immediate response and Michigan’s statewide sampling efforts, which revealed the contamination at Robinson Elementary School. The next step is to buy a PFAS filter for her home, Stef said, but the hardware is expensive. She suspects other wells in the area may also be contaminated from whatever unknown source has impacted the school, and hopes more residences and businesses are tested. “Out here, everybody has wells,” she said. “I figured if they found it at the school, what is the likelihood that a few miles away it wouldn’t be in our water?” Robinson Elementary School has been stocked with bottled water since Monday, and its staff and students have stopped drinking tap water and using it for food preparation. Grand Haven Area Public Schools Superintendent Andy Ingall said fourth-graders have begun a collection effort to recycle the used water bottles and, under the circumstances, school activities are proceeding normally. PFAS refers to a large group of chemical compounds linked in human studies to forms of cancer, thyroid disease, elevated cholesterol and other diseases. Known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS do not break down in the environment, and are used commonly in firefighting foam, fast-food wrappers, nonstick cookware and water repellent materials. Guidance for homeowners to receive testing of their private well water is available on the DEQ website.

 <p>NORTON SHORES — Testing for PFAS in Muskegon County has uncovered four residences in Norton Shores with levels well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lifetime health advisory.</p> NORTON SHORES — Testing for PFAS in Muskegon County has uncovered four residences in Norton Shores with levels well above the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s lifetime health advisory. The highest residential sample among the four contained 563.7 parts per trillion (ppt) of combined perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). The EPA limit is 70 ppt. All four homes are on well water. One of the homes is currently vacant, according to Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Communications Director Scott Dean. Muskegon County has provided bottled water to the other three and is in the process of installing filters. DEQ sampling in September detected 2 ppt of PFAS in Muskegon’s city water supply. The county has so far sampled about 48 residences, Dean said, and has received results for 23. Three of the residences with high PFAS levels are on the 500 block of Porter Road, the 400 block of Wendover Boulevard and the 100 block of West Byron Road. Sharon Polidan lives on West Lane, about two blocks from Wendover Boulevard. Her home is connected to Mona Shores municipal water, she said, which gets its water from the city of Muskegon. Polidan said she wasn’t aware that nearby residents used wells for anything other than watering their lawns. Polidan said she has always considered her water safe, but has kept a close eye on PFAS in the news. She used to live in Kalamazoo and said she was stunned when samples of water from the nearby city of Parchment discovered PFAS levels in the thousands ppt. “When the government tries to deregulate everything so that a corporation that is polluting makes more profit, and they manage to hide so much evidence from the public, it could be a lot more severe than anybody knows,” she said. Polidan lives near Mona Lake, where she said residents are conscientious of their impact on wetlands and wildlife. Residents with waterfront property have stopped using fertilizer with phosphorus to combat algal blooms, she said, and groundwater contamination may be alarming to them. PFAS refers to a group of chemical compounds linked in human studies to forms of cancer, thyroid disorders, elevated cholesterol and other disease. The chemicals are water and lipid resistant; are found throughout the environment; and are commonly used in firefighting foam, water-repellent materials, fast-food wrappers and non-stick cookware. High PFAS levels were discovered in October at Robinson Elementary School in Robinson Township. Testing of the well water there found a combined PFOA and PFOS level of 110 ppt and 119 ppt in two rounds of sampling. A DEQ and Ottawa County Department of Public Health investigation is ongoing to find the source of the contamination in Robinson Township, and 25 residents are awaiting results of state testing. Results are expected in the next two weeks.

 By The Associated Press <p>PORTAGE, Ind. — A water sample from Lake Michigan near a wastewater spill at a U.S. Steel plant in Indiana contained an elevated level of a potentially carcinogenic chemical but well below federal safety standards, the Chicago Department of Water Management said Thursday.</p> PORTAGE, Ind. — A water sample from Lake Michigan near a wastewater spill at a U.S. Steel plant in Indiana contained an elevated level of a potentially carcinogenic chemical but well below federal safety standards, the Chicago Department of Water Management said Thursday. A sample containing 2 parts per billion of hexavalent chromium was taken in the lake about a mile north of the spill in Portage, Indiana, about 30 miles east of Chicago, the agency said. That's "a level higher than would be expected to be found in raw lake water," the department said in a news release, but it's just a fraction of the Environmental Protection Agency's drinking water standard of 100 parts per billion for all forms of chromium. A second sample taken nearby contained 1.6 parts per billion of hexavalent chromium, but 10 other samples taken in the same general area contained levels no higher than 0.21 parts per billion, agency data showed. The EPA expects to start receiving results Friday from about 200 water samples it has collected following the Tuesday spill, spokeswoman Rachel Bassler said. "Preliminary data suggests that hexavalent chromium from the spill is not present near drinking water intakes," Bassler said. The EPA has said hexavalent chromium — a toxic byproduct of industrial processes — might be carcinogenic if ingested. The toxic heavy metal is used in a variety of industrial processes, including steelmaking and corrosion prevention, and as a pigment in dyes, paints and inks. It's also found in ash from coal-fired power plants. A case involving the chemical was made famous by the 2000 film "Erin Brockovich," which was based on a utility's disposal of water laced with hexavalent chromium in unlined ponds near Hinkley, California. That disposal method polluted drinking water wells and resulted in a $333 million settlement. U.S. Steel has said its release of the chemical was stopped at the source. It's not known yet how much was spilled, Bassler said. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel condemned the company's "careless conduct." "U.S. Steel must immediately explain how they allowed a dangerous chemical into a Lake Michigan tributary where it could harm millions of people in Indiana and Illinois, and what they are doing to ensure this never happens again," Emanuel said in a statement Thursday. U.S. Steel issued a statement Thursday evening saying it's identified the source of Tuesday's spill and "has made the necessary repairs." "We are reviewing a potential restart plan to best serve our customers, employees and the community," the company said. U.S. Steel previously said that an expansion joint failed in a pipe, allowing wastewater to flow into the wrong treatment plant at the Portage complex. That wastewater eventually flowed into the Burns Waterway, a lake tributary, at a point about 100 yards from Lake Michigan. A water utility stopped drawing water from the lake and three beaches at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and one in adjacent Ogden Dunes have been closed as a precaution.

 <p>PORTAGE, Ind. — Chemical tests at an Indiana tributary that feeds Lake Michigan are coming up clear following a spill of a potentially carcinogenic chemical.</p> PORTAGE, Ind. — Chemical tests at an Indiana tributary that feeds Lake Michigan are coming up clear following a spill of a potentially carcinogenic chemical. The Burns Waterway has been tested weekly for hexavalent chromium following April's spill at a U.S. Steel facility, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported. Nearly 300 pounds of the chemical was spilled, which is more than 580 times the daily maximum limit allowed under state law. Coming into direct contact with the chemical can cause skin reactions. The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is assisting U.S. Steel with long-term monitoring of four beaches on the waterway. U.S. Steel conducts water testing at Indiana American Water's intake in Ogden Dunes. "This is simply about keeping visitors safe," said Charles Morris, an environmental protection specialist at the National Lakeshore. He said none of the samples taken from the beaches so far have shown a concentration above the 0.03 milligrams per liter minimum detection level for hexavalent chromium. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's drinking water standard is 0.1 milligrams per liter. Sampling will continue until the end of August. The April spill prompted the temporary closure of several area beaches and the intake in Ogden Dunes. They were later reopened once EPA tests found no traces of the chemical. Lake Michigan provides drinking water to many residents in Lake, Porter, and LaPorte counties.

 <p >Harmful algae blooms have become a top water polluter, fueled by fertilizers washing into lakes, streams and oceans. Federal and state programs have spent billions of dollars on cost-sharing payments to farmers to help prevent nutrient runoff, yet the problem is worsening in many places. Here's a look at the algae menace and what's being done:</p> Harmful algae blooms have become a top water polluter, fueled by fertilizers washing into lakes, streams and oceans. Federal and state programs have spent billions of dollars on cost-sharing payments to farmers to help prevent nutrient runoff, yet the problem is worsening in many places. Here's a look at the algae menace and what's being done: ANCIENT ORGANISMS, NEW THREAT Among the oldest life forms, algae are simple aquatic plants that form key links in food chains. Some types of bacteria are also considered algae, including cyanobacteria, or "blue-green algae," which is increasingly common across the U.S. Scientists believe a combination of factors can trigger large blooms, including warm temperatures, slow water circulation and excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Among nutrient sources are runoff from farms and urban lawns as well as industrial wastes and sewage. Some blooms generate toxins such as microcystin, which can cause nausea, fever and liver damage in humans and kill animals. A federal study detected microcystin in nearly 40 percent of lakes sampled around the nation, although mostly at below-harmful levels. Even when blooms aren't toxic, they can turn waters ugly shades of green or other colors, stink like rotten vegetables, foul beaches and kill fish by sucking oxygen from the water as they decompose. A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM The U.S. isn't alone. Many countries are experiencing "disturbing trends of increasing bloom incidence" and growing economic losses, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. China's largest blooms on record washed onto beaches in 2013 from the Yellow Sea, as bulldozers scraped up rotting mats by the ton. A bloom the size of Mexico spreads across the Arabian Sea twice a year. In Australia, blue-green algae extended more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) on the Murray River in 2016. A European Commission study says blooms in Greece, Italy and Spain cost the economy $355 million (300 million euros) annually. University of Alberta researchers say microcystin has been detected in more than 240 Canadian water bodies. Lake Winnipeg algae blooms are so large that they're visible from space. IS CLIMATE CHANGE BEHIND THIS? Many scientists believe global warming is making conditions more favorable for algae blooms, primarily by raising water temperatures and causing heavier rainstorms that wash more nutrients into waterways. A study in the journal Science this year said nitrogen runoff into lakes, rivers and bays could increase 19 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising. Climate change research in the journal Environmental Science and Technology predicts the number of days U.S. reservoirs are infected with blue-green blooms could triple by 2050. PLAYING CATCH-UP Congress first enacted legislation to deal with harmful algae in 1998 and has updated it several times, with another version pending. Critics say it's too little and too slow. A White House report last year said progress had been made in forecasting blooms and issuing warnings. The Governmental Accountability Office said 12 agencies had spent $101 million on studies and monitoring between 2013 and 2015. But only in 2014 was the law updated to make inland waters a priority; the focus previously had been on coastal areas and the Great Lakes. Even then, no funding was included for inland water study. And the law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, with no limits and no enforcement provisions. WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION MEASURES? The Associated Press obtained data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the costliest of several programs that help farmers avoid pollution. The agency awarded $1.8 billion between 2009 and 2016 for use of 45 practices intended to prevent fertilizer runoff. The five most heavily funded included upgrading irrigation systems; managing brush growth; planting "cover crops" in fall and winter that hold soil in place and absorb fertilizers; stabilizing erosion-prone areas used by livestock; and developing plans for applying fertilizer in ways that will minimize runoff. Another popular measure is planting grass or other vegetation between croplands and streams. Farmers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Indiana and Nebraska were pledged the most funding between 2009 and 2016. Farmers in Sussex County, Delaware, a top poultry-producing area, received $17 million over the seven years, the most of any U.S. county.

 <p>A recent local community columnist, Barbara Mezeske wrote how we take water, one of our most precious resources for granted (“Our most precious resource we take for granted,” Feb. 20).</p> A recent local community columnist, Barbara Mezeske wrote how we take water, one of our most precious resources for granted (“Our most precious resource we take for granted,” Feb. 20). In the Holland-Zeeland area, we have one of the most safe and abundant water supply coming from Lake Michigan. But just 30 miles east of here in the Rockford area, contaminated ground water wells have been found to have high levels of a dangerous chemical. This chemical, PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), came from the Wolverine Co. makers of Hush Puppies and were dumped on land where many homes now are located. Needless to say, some serious medical issues are being linked to this due to the contamination. The Trump administration has proposed budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency by at least 30 percent. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which funds environmental cleanup is being cut by 90 percent. Many past regulations regarding the pollution of our lakes and oceans have been removed by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. If there was a governmental agency that needs to have more funding, it would be the EPA. The 2016 Waters of the United States rule was suspended by Trump last year because he felt it interferes with economic development. It will also interfere with our health by suspending it. So Holland-Zeeland residents, don’t take your drinking water for granted! Write Rep. Bill Huizenga or Rep. Fred Upton and encourage them to fight against Trump’s anti-environmental policies. Your grandchildren and future generations depend on us to protect the safety of their waters and rivers. Wally Rooks

 <p>ROBINSON TWP. — If you dig a 5-foot hole in Robinson Township, you’ll hit water.</p> ROBINSON TWP . — If you dig a 5-foot hole in Robinson Township, you’ll hit water. The area’s shallow aquifer is the subject of scrutiny this month as the Department of Environmental Quality digs wells in search of the source of PFAS contamination. Standing on the southeast end of the Robinson Elementary School grounds Thursday, DEQ geologist Paul Knoerr held up 5-foot cylindrical tube — called a sleeve — to show bands of coarse sediment laced amid fine wet sand. The soil sample had just emerged from around 25 feet beneath the school grounds. Geologists examined the sediment and recorded observations, picking through the pebbles, comparing the sand to a color matching chart. At 25 and 50 feet, water samples were collected. Knoerr said he expects both shallow and deep samples from the hydrogeologic investigation to reveal PFAS above 70 parts per trillion, as high concentrations were detected at the school in October. If this happens, the 120th Avenue area investigation will become an official PFAS contamination site — one of 43 around Michigan. Robinson Elementary is the only school in the state with these high readings, causing students and staff to rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking since fall. In November and December, the DEQ sampled more than 60 residential wells, mostly north of the school along 120th Avenue. Traces of PFAS have shown up throughout the area, but the school’s samples are still the highest concentrations. This means the source should be at or very near the school, according to Knoerr. If you dig about 50 feet, you reach a layer of clay at the bottom of the sandy aquifer. Knoerr said the geology is uniform and horizontal, flowing north toward the Grand River. Without a steep gradient, the groundwater moves slowly. But as sediment becomes more coarse and large-grain, it moves faster. PFAS tends to move toward water, and moves quickly through large-grain sediment. “The PFAS is going to run through the stuff that moves fast,” Knoerr said. “Wherever it goes, that stuff wants to hook into that water and it’s going to run. That’s why we’re seeing something here that might be impacting something a distance away from here.” PFAS was also discovered south of the school. Knoerr said agricultural irrigation in the area could temporarily alter the flow of groundwater, drawing it southward. A source could also be located farther south. The DEQ commonly cleans up well-understood chemicals. Gasoline, for instance, is lighter than water, and is usually found in the shallow soil. Dry cleaning solvent is denser than water, Knoerr said, and will sink below the water table. “We don’t know what happens with PFAS,” Knoerr said. He said the substances are likely denser than water, due to their large molecular structure, but the large group of chemical compounds linked to numerous health risks remains mysterious. Drilling deep, even with the powerful Geoprobe, involves a lot of waiting. Metal tubes are lined up to deliver the sleeve to the next layer of earth. “Every single time, everything’s got to come out of the hole and back down again,” Knoerr said. Monitoring wells are being placed around the school, and east across 120th Avenue on Robinson Township property. Sampling should last through next week, Knoerr said, and results are expected in about four weeks. Once the ice melts, the DEQ will also sample water from a few nearby ponds. If those results reveal PFAS, new exposure routes could be considered — such as through contaminated fish and deer. It’s possible that a source will never be discovered, Knoerr said. He described the investigative method as using Occam’s razor, a problem-solving principle that states that the simplest solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones. A lot of the area’s wells lack documentation. Their depths are unknown. Environmental regulations were not in vogue before the 1970s, and potential sources, such as dump sites, may also lack documentation. The investigation is a journey into the past — to forgotten human activity, and to Michigan’s glacial origin.  “We’re trying to recreate history,” Knoerr said.

 That torrent is poisoning aquatic life and tainting drinking water sources in Montana, California, Colorado, Oklahoma and at least five other states. <p>RIMINI, Mont. — Every day many millions of gallons of water loaded with arsenic, lead and other toxic metals flow from some of the most contaminated mining sites in the U.S. and into surrounding streams and ponds without being treated, The Associated Press has found.</p> RIMINI, Mont. — Every day many millions of gallons of water loaded with arsenic, lead and other toxic metals flow from some of the most contaminated mining sites in the U.S. and into surrounding streams and ponds without being treated, The Associated Press has found. That torrent is poisoning aquatic life and tainting drinking water sources in Montana, California, Colorado, Oklahoma and at least five other states. The pollution is a legacy of how the mining industry was allowed to operate in the U.S. for more than a century. Companies that built mines for silver, lead, gold and other "hardrock" minerals could move on once they were no longer profitable, leaving behind tainted water that still leaks out of the mines or is cleaned up at taxpayer expense. Using data from public records requests and independent researchers, the AP examined 43 mining sites under federal oversight, some containing dozens or even hundreds of individual mines. The records show that at average flows, more than 50 million gallons of contaminated wastewater streams daily from the sites. In many cases, it runs untreated into nearby groundwater, rivers and ponds — a roughly 20-million-gallon daily dose of pollution that could fill more than 2,000 tanker trucks. The remainder of the waste is captured or treated in a costly effort that will need to carry on indefinitely, for perhaps thousands of years, often with little hope for reimbursement. The volumes vastly exceed the release from Colorado's Gold King Mine disaster in 2015, when a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup crew inadvertently triggered the release of 3 million gallons of mustard-colored mine sludge, fouling rivers in three states. At many mines, the pollution has continued decades after their enlistment in the federal Superfund cleanup program for the nation's most hazardous sites, which faces sharp cuts under President Donald Trump. Federal officials fear that at least six of the sites examined by AP could have blowouts like the one at Gold King. Some sites feature massive piles or impoundments of mine waste known as tailings. A tailings dam collapse in Brazil last month killed at least 169 people and left 140 missing. A similar 2014 accident in British Columbia swept millions of cubic yards of contaminated mud into a nearby lake, resulting in one of Canada's worst environmental disasters. But even short of a calamitous accident, many mines pose the chronic problem of relentless pollution. TAINTED WELLS In mountains outside the Montana capital of Helena, about 30 households can't drink their tap water because groundwater was polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines that operated from the 1870s until 1953. The community of Rimini was added to the Superfund list in 1999. Contaminated soil in residents' yards was replaced, and the EPA has provided bottled water for a decade. But polluted water still pours from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek. "The fact that bottled water is provided is great," said 30-year Rimini resident Catherine Maynard, a natural resources analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "Where it falls short is it's not piped into our home. Water that's piped into our home is still contaminated water. Washing dishes and bathing — that metal-laden water is still running through our pipes." Estimates of the number of such abandoned mine sites range from 161,000 in 12 western states to as many as 500,000 nationwide. At least 33,000 have degraded the environment, according to the Government Accountability Office, and thousands more are discovered every year. Officials have yet to complete work including basic risk analyses on about 80 percent of abandoned mining sites on federal lands. Most are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which under Trump is seeking to consolidate mine cleanups with another program and cut their combined 2019 spending from $35 million to $13 million. PERPETUAL POLLUTION Problems at some sites are intractable. Among them: • In eastern Oklahoma's Tar Creek mining district, waterways are devoid of life and elevated lead levels persist in the blood of children despite a two-decade effort to clean up lead and zinc mines. More than $300 million has been committed since 1983, but only a small fraction of the impacted land has been reclaimed and contaminated water continues to flow. • At northern California's Iron Mountain Mine, cleanup teams battle to contain highly acidic water that percolates through a former copper and zinc mine and drains into a Sacramento River tributary. The mine discharged six tons of toxic sludge daily before an EPA cleanup. Authorities now spend $5 million a year to remove poisonous sludge that had caused massive fish kills, and they expect to keep at it forever. • In Colorado's San Juan Mountains, site of the Gold King blowout, some 400 abandoned or inactive mine sites contribute an estimated 15 million gallons of acid mine drainage per day. This landscape of polluted sites occurred under mining industry rules largely unchanged since the 1872 Mining Act. State and federal laws in recent decades have held companies more accountable than in the past, but critics say huge loopholes all but ensure that some of today's mines will foul waterways or require perpetual cleanups. To avoid a catastrophe like Gold King, EPA officials now require advance approval for work on many mining sites. But they acknowledge they're only dealing with a small portion of the problem. "We have been trying to play a very careful game of prioritization," said Dana Stalcup, deputy director of the Superfund program. "We know the Superfund program is not the answer to the hundreds of thousands of mines out there, but the mines we are working on we want to do them the best we can." The 43 sites examined by AP are ones where officials and researchers have reliable estimates of polluted water releases. Officials say flow rates vary, and the AP used low flow data for several sites where average flows were not available. QUESTIONS OVER WHO SHOULD PAY To date, the EPA has spent an estimated $4 billion on mining cleanups. Under Trump, the agency has identified a small number of Superfund sites for heightened attention after cleanup efforts stalled or dragged on for years. They include five mining sites examined by AP. Former EPA assistant administrator Mathy Stanislaus said more money is needed to address mining pollution on a systematic basis, rather than jumping from one emergency response to another. "The piecemeal approach is just not working," said Stanislaus, who oversaw the Superfund program for almost eight years ending in 2017. Democrats have sought unsuccessfully to create a special cleanup fund for old hardrock mine sites, with fees paid by the mining industry. Such a fund has been in place for coal mines since 1977, with more than $11 billion in fees collected and hundreds of sites reclaimed. The mining industry has resisted doing the same for hardrock mines, and Republicans in Congress have blocked the Democratic proposals. Montana Mining Association director Tammy Johnson acknowledged abandoned mines have left a legacy of pollution, but added that companies still in operation should not be forced to pay for those problems. "Back in the day there really wasn't a lot known about acid mine drainage," she said. "I just don't think that today's companies bear the responsibility." In 2017, the EPA proposed requiring companies still operating mines to post cleanup bonds or offer other financial assurances so taxpayers don't end up footing cleanup bills. The Trump administration halted the rule, but environmental groups are scheduled to appear in federal court next month in a lawsuit that seeks to revive it. "When something gets on a Superfund site, that doesn't mean it instantly and magically gets cleaned up," said Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin. " Having money immediately available from a responsible party would be a game changer."

 Drifts of floating plastic that humans have dumped into the world's oceans are flowing into the pristine waters of the Arctic as a result of a powerful system of currents that deposits waste in the icy seas east of Greenland and north of Scandinavia. In 2013, as part of a seven-month circumnavigation of the Arctic Ocean, scientists aboard the research vessel Tara documented a profusion of tiny pieces of plastic in the Greenland and Barents seas, where the final limb of the Gulf Stream system delivers Atlantic waters northward. The researchers dub this region the "dead end for floating plastics" after their long surf of the world's oceans. The researchers say this is just the beginning of the plastic migration to Arctic waters. "It's only been about 60 years since we started using plastic industrially, and the usage and the production has been increasing ever since," said Carlos Duarte, one of the study's co-authors and director of the Red Sea Research Center at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. " So, most of the plastic that we have disposed in the ocean is still now in transit to the Arctic." The results were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. The study was led by Andrés Cózar of the University of Cádiz in Spain along with 11 other researchers from universities in eight nations: Denmark, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The researchers estimated that about 300 billion pieces of tiny plastic are suspended in these Arctic waters right now, although they said the amount could be higher. And they think there is even more plastic on the seafloor. Several factors support the idea that the plastic entered these waters via ocean currents rather than local pollution. First, the Arctic has a very small population that is unlikely to directly contribute so much waste. Also, the aged and weathered state of the plastic, and the tiny size of the pieces found, suggested that it had traveled the seas for decades, breaking down along the way. "The plastic pieces that may have been initially inches or feet in size, they have been brittled by exposure to the sun and then fragmented into increasingly smaller particles, and eventually led to this millimeter-size plastic that we call microplastic," Duarte said. "That process takes years to decades. So the type of material that we're seeing there has indications that it has entered the ocean decades ago." Finally, the study didn't find much plastic in the rest of the Arctic ocean beyond the Greenland and Barents seas, also suggesting that currents were to blame. Instead the plastic had accumulated where the northward-flowing Atlantic waters plunge into the Arctic depths. Presumably, the plastic then lingers at the surface. The Greenland and Barents seas contained 95 percent of the Arctic's plastic, the research found (the ship sampled 42 sites across the Arctic Ocean). The Barents Sea happens to be a major fishery for cod, haddock, herring and other species. A key question will be how the plastic is affecting these animals. The study's results sent a troubling message to one researcher who has also focused on the consequences of plastic debris in the oceans and other waterways. "Isn't it kind of ironic that days before Earth Day there is more demonstrated proof of widespread contamination of our plastic waste in places that are so far from the human footprint and thus locations we consider to be pristine," said Chelsea Rochman, a marine ecologist at the University of Toronto who was not involved in the study but praised it as "a great contribution to the field." The ocean circulation system in the Atlantic responsible for this plastic transport is part of a far larger "thermohaline" ocean system driven by the temperature and salt content of oceans. It is also often called an "overturning" circulation because cold, salty waters sink in the North Atlantic and travel back southward at deep ocean depths. As humans now put 8 million tons of plastic in the ocean annually, learning how such currents affect the plastic's global distribution is a key scientific focus. Researchers, including Duarte, previously found that plastic slowly travels the world's oceans but tends to linger in five "gyres," or circular ocean currents in the subtropical oceans in both the northern and southern hemispheres. One of those gyres is located in the Atlantic, which then feeds the Arctic. Scientists noted that the vast majority of ocean plastic becomes lost before it reaches the Arctic. They aren't sure where most of the plastic falls out and are researching to determine those locations. " The plastic that escapes those traps is the one that actually makes it into the Arctic," Duarte said. "But when it enters the Arctic, there is no way out, it just stays there and is stuck there." Because it takes such a long time for plastic to travel across the world in ocean currents, the study concludes that the current waste is largely the work of North Americans and Europeans, who dumped it in the Atlantic. Waste from other parts of the world that dump huge volumes of plastic into the oceans is still in transit. Rochman said she feared that as the Arctic becomes more accessible because of ice melt linked to climate change, more plastic could wash in. " As the ice melts, we may see increasing concentrations of plastic in the Arctic due to the opening of passageways for vessels and plastics in surface currents," she said, "as well as plastics in the ice becoming free to float and interact with marine animals upon melting."

 First Hurricane Irma blew through. Then the electricity went out. Then a work crew made an error while working on a pump station in the sewage system. And soon, 2,000 gallons of raw sewage was spilling onto a quiet residential street of ranch houses in Edgewater, a town south of Daytona Beach. Benirose Demetita, administrator of Regency Elderly Care across the street, watched as city workers scrambled to contain the fetid mixture that spewed along Mango Tree Drive. "These guys from the city worked 24 hours trying to get that under control," Demetita said. The spill was one of scores of discharges of poorly treated wastewater and raw sewage into streets, lakes, rivers and neighborhoods, described in pollution filings that poured into the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. In one incident, the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer authority discharged six million gallons of partially treated wastewater - "secondary effluent" - into Biscayne Bay. Bloomberg News said pollution spills reported to the state of Florida totaled 9 million gallons by Tuesday, and that number has continued to grow in recent days. While runoff from chemical plants and oil refineries dirtied waters along the Texas Gulf Coast, sewage and other wastewater has posed the most immediate problem in Florida, raising the risk of disease, triggering algae blooms that can suffocate fish and other marine creatures, and complicating cleanup days after Hurricane Irma moved north. "Even without hurricanes, the five U.S. Gulf Coast states are highly vulnerable to disease due to a unique mix of poverty, climate change and heat stress (the highest in North America), aggressive urbanization, and human migrations," Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said in an email. "We are a global 'hotspot' for neglected tropical diseases. Now the hurricanes threaten to further amplify this problem." Because of its flat terrain, Florida relies heavily on wastewater lift stations with pumps to move sewage. Those pumps require electricity. In 2012, the state required that pumping stations be able to withstand 25-year floods, or in some cases 10-year floods. But after Irma, electricity has been in short supply, with millions of customers cut off along with the sewage pump stations. With the power out, pumps didn't work in the town of Weeki Wachee, about an hour's drive north of Tampa, and 2,500 gallons of wastewater was spilled into a wetland area next to a residential street. Pumps lost power in Clearwater, and 338,000 gallons of partially treated effluent flowed into Stevenson Creek. In St. Petersburg, after a power failure shut off sewage pumps, two locations each sent more than 3,000 gallons containing raw sewage into the Clam Bayou and Big Bayou. In Miami-Dade County, an estimated 30,256 gallons of raw sewage poured into a small public park on the edge of Big Bayou for more than four hours before the utility stanched the flow. In all these cases, the sewage and water utility said it has spread lime on the discharges and pronounced them cleaned up. Kelly Cox, a staff attorney and program director for the environmental group Miami Waterkeeper, said her inbox was full of email alerts from Florida's DEP about reports of unauthorized sewage overflows and other spills. "It's been unreal to see," Cox said. "It's one after the other. . . . It's kind of mind blowing at this point." Cox said that South Florida, in particular, has faced water challenges for generations, due to its low elevation near the ocean, its aging infrastructure and the porous limestone rock that much of the area sits upon. In addition, Cox said, nearly a third of residents rely upon septic systems that can become overwhelmed during storms. And the area's sewage systems also are old, low-lying and unable to handle the flow of water an Irma-like storm brings. "A lot of our treatment plans have the ability to handle double the normal capacity," she said. " [But] when a storm the magnitude of Irma hits, you're way over capacity. . . . Our systems are overburdened by this storm." "Florida's wastewater system is increasing in age and the condition of installed treatment and conveyance systems is declining," said a report last year by the American Society of Civil Engineers. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the total needs in Florida's wastewater infrastructure increased from $12.7 billion in 2004 to $17.1 billion in 2008 to 18.4 billion in 2012. Those costs are likely to continue rising, as municipalities replace pipes, treatment plants and other drinking water systems even as the state's population continues to grow. Dee Ann Miller, a spokeswoman for the Florida DEP, said that Florida's Clean Water State Revolving Fund program provides low-interest loans aimed at planning, designing and constructing water pollution control facilities. The program has awarded more than $4 billion in loans for wastewater and storm water improvement projects since its inception in 1989, she said. The EPA this week wrote to the head of the Florida DEP, assuring the agency that federal officials would be understanding when it comes to the release of contaminated stormwater discharges happening across the state. "Hurricane Irma has produced circumstances beyond the reasonable control for some permitters to maintain full compliance with their permit provisions," an EPA official wrote. "The EPA also recognizes there may be other unforeseen issues that arise as a result of this disaster and we stand ready to work together with our state partners to address these potential issues as they arise. The EPA recognizes the importance of keeping these facilities operating and where necessary getting the facilities back on line as soon as possible." As the waters recede, the reports of pollution violations to the Florida DEP have mounted. In many places, wastewater systems ran backward. In an neighborhood of Orlando, flooding caused a filter system to overflow and about 10,000 gallons of partly treated effluent bubbled up through the manhole covers. A sewer backed up into six homes and the sewage ran into storm water ponds. Other harmful chemicals have been mixed in with Florida's wastewater. A fallen tree ruptured a fuel tank line for an irrigation system, spilling 200 gallons of fuel into Lake Reedy in Frostproof. Ramping up shuttered facilities also has perils. In DeLand, the powering up of a sewage system caused a 1,000-gallon surge of untreated domestic wastewater into a business. "We learned a lot of lessons after Katrina," Hotez said. "We learned that prolonged contact with floodwaters on the Gulf leads to terrible skin infections from Staphylococcus, including antibiotic resistant Staph, also a unique Vibrio bacterial infection on the Gulf that can lead to sepsis and death." "We learned that floodwaters can have high 'coliform' bacterial counts from sewage contamination - meaning intestinal bacterial infections," Hotez said. "We can anticipate the health impact of both Harvey and Irma will be with us for the next few weeks."

 Township supervisor Dale Witt said the dumping on Academy Road has been an ongoing concern. <p> Illegal dumping is a problem in Raisin Township.<br><br>From its recycling center behind the township hall to Academy Road, township officials are concerned about people not following the rules when it comes to getting rid of unwanted stuff.<br/><br/>Township supervisor Dale Witt said the dumping on Academy Road has been an ongoing concern. He said couches, chairs and mattresses frequently are left on the side of the road. This past month, some of these were set on fire, which led to the Raisin Township Fire Department responding to the scene.<br/><br/>“It’s unfortunate that people keep doing this ,” Witt said of the dumping on Academy. “I’m not sure what the solution is, but we, including the county, need to work to stop it. ”<br/><br/>The issue at the township’s recycling drop station involves people leaving behind items not allowed in the large bins. Witt said they are seeing such things as mattresses and building materials left behind. The only items accepted are steel and aluminum cans, plastic bottles and food containers, glass containers, paper and cardboard.<br/><br/>Witt said they will be looking to take measures, from surveillance to posting a sign stating the fine for illegal dumping, to prevent it from happening at the drop station.<br/><br/>The township does have three annual dump days in which items being illegally dumped could be dropped off at the designated location. Witt said these days cost the township, and in turn the taxpayers, $4,000, each. He said he wonders if another day needs to be added to prevent illegal dumping.</br></br></p > Illegal dumping is a problem in Raisin Township.

 It began as a smell from the newer type of fertilizer brought to the field around three weeks ago. <p> Some homeowners along Murphy Highway are concerned about the short-term and long-term effects on their health and environment from the biosolids fertilizer placed onto a field in their neighborhood.<br><br> It began as a smell from the newer type of fertilizer brought to the field around three weeks ago. At first, Tecumseh Township resident Kris Cox thought it may have been a dead animal near by, but she said the smell also had a scent that was “chemical-like. ”<br/><br/>She said the smell quickly began to impact her health as well as some of her neighbors. A similar situation occurred last year in Adrian Township.<br/><br/>“I feel like this is hurting me and I fear the potential effect it may have on my grandchildren when they come to visit,” said Cox, who reported having respiratory issues, bloody noses and severe headaches after the fertilizer was delivered and spread.<br/><br/>She said a neighboring family also has reported having health issues, specifically with their children.<br/><br/>The smell was coming from bio-pellets, which were made at a Detroit-based plant operated by the New England Fertilizer Company. They were placed on a field at Murphy Highway and Allen Road by Raisin Township farmer Andy Rebottaro, who could not be reached for comment at the time this article was written.<br/><br/>The pellets are defined as nutrient-rich organic materials resulting from the treatment of domestic sewage in a treatment facility.<br/><br/>Michigan Department of Environmental Quality spokesman Greg Merricle said it was an approved application of the biosolids pellets produced at the Detroit plant. He said he responded to some of the complaints on Tuesday morning, but didn’t find the odor to be above normal. Cox said the smell is more intense at certain times, especially early in the morning and during the evening; it also is affected by weather conditions.<br/><br/>“I don’t doubt that the odor was bad over night and while it was being spread,” Merricle said.<br/><br/>He said he met with some neighbors and heard their concerns, and met with the farmer when he showed up on site to incorporate the pellets.<br/><br/>Additionally, he said Thursday, Rebottaro intended on putting lime on the field to adjust the soil pH as soon as possible. He said this should prevent any odor issues from persisting.<br/><br/>“That should put an end to the odor on its own,” Merricle said.<br/><br/>“My inspection revealed nothing outside of what is allowed as far as the application goes. Obviously, we don’t want to inconvenience or upset neighbors, so we’ll evaluate this one to see what could have been done differently. ”<br/><br/>However, it’s not just the smell that concerns the neighboring homeowners.<br/><br/>“The smell will go away, but there are many unknowns with this,” said neighboring homeowner Lana Callihan, who grew up on a farm. “This is a new type of fertilizer, so I’m not sure they know its full impact on the environment, water and people’s health. ”<br/><br/>Callihan said she doesn’t want to come across as complaining, but she’s concerned. Since the application, her eyes have become irritated and she’s had severe headaches.<br/><br/>Cox said the pellets application, which kicked up a lot of dust, has left the pond in her backyard with a film of scum, a kind she has not seen before.<br/><br/>“This might be legal and more cost effective for farmers, but its impact on our health and the environment is unknown,” she said. “It’s deeply concerning. ”</br></br></p> Some homeowners along Murphy Highway are concerned about the short-term and long-term effects on their health and environment from the biosolids fertilizer placed onto a field in their neighborhood.

 <p>ADRIAN — When Alice Mackey purchased her home in Adrian 23 years ago she thought she would live there until her dying days. <br><br> Her plan changed eight years ago when she was told by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality her property was contaminated with perchloroethylene, which is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics. <br/><br/>Now her goal is to get the word out on her home, knowing she may soon lose it to foreclosure and being a real estate agent she said the bank doesn’t necessarily have to disclose the property ’s condition.<br/><br/>“I want it known that it’s contaminated,” Mackey said. “If I didn’t care I could just rent it out, but I won’t because someone else might get sick.” <br/><br/>Her home is at 126 Greenly St. and for a long time there was a dry cleaning business behind her residence, which eventually closed up shop and moved it operations elsewhere. <br/><br/>Knowing the DEQ’s assessment , she said her ongoing health issues began making sense. For years, while living in the home, she experienced such ailments as various skin irritations and swollen eyes. Her health issues became more severe over the years and eventually she was diagnosed as having toxic chemical dermatitis.<br/><br/>The DEQ had a soil and gas interceptor installed, but her health did not improve and for a long time she was prescribed steroids. However, those began hurting health over time as well and she was left with one solution.<br/><br/>For the past year and a half she’s been living with her son, and feeling better. The DEQ has issued a declaration of restrictive covenant on the property, which means if it’s to be sold by her the buyer would have to clean up the contamination. She said she knows no one will buy a home with these issues and concerns.<br/><br/>And she’s been told the statue of limitations to file a law suit against the former dry cleaners had passed and she should have done that back in 2008. As far as any governmental help, she said there hasn’t been any. She said she’s not paying for a home that’s been contaminated by someone else, so it will soon leave her hands.<br/><br/>“I hope the city would condemn it and tear it down,” she said of a possible solution.</br></br></p> ADRIAN — When Alice Mackey purchased her home in Adrian 23 years ago she thought she would live there until her dying days.

 <p>ADRIAN — The state of Michigan is designating its section of Lake Erie as an impaired waterway because of damage to fish and other wildlife caused by harmful algal blooms, officials said Thursday.</p> ADRIAN — The state of Michigan is designating its section of Lake Erie as an impaired waterway because of damage to fish and other wildlife caused by harmful algal blooms, officials said Thursday. The declaration affects only the part of the lake under Michigan’s jurisdiction, which is less than 2 percent. But it was required under the federal Clean Water Act after shoreline monitoring and analysis of satellite imagery showed that the western Lake Erie basin was failing to meet Michigan water quality standards, said Heidi Grether, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality. “Michigan’s portion of Lake Erie is small but, in making this determination, we signal the importance of our actions to date and our commitment moving forward to limit the incidences of severe algal blooms that impact aquatic life and wildlife in our waters,” Grether told the Associated Press. Pam Taylor, a full-time volunteer with the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan, told The Daily Telegram in an email that Michigan went further than Ohio, which only declared certain sections of the Lake Erie coastline and the area around the Toledo water intake impaired. “Michigan has declared the open waters of the western Lake Erie basin impaired for phosphorus,” Taylor wrote. “This will eventually impact sources in all waterways draining into the Michigan portion of the western basin of Lake Erie, including the tributaries. This is a very big step in the right direction. Michigan did much better than Ohio, in this case.” Outbreaks of blue-green algae — which is actually a type of bacteria that can produce toxins — have plagued the lake since the 1990s, at times coating large sections in pea-green slime. Contamination in 2014 left more than 400,000 people in Toledo and parts of southeastern Michigan unable to drink tap water for two days. The 2015 bloom was the largest on record — covering an area the size of New York City. This year’s bloom was smaller because there were fewer storms that washed phosphorus-laden fertilizers into the lake. But toxicity levels were higher, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Michigan, Ohio and the Canadian province of Ontario agreed in 2015 to seek a 40 percent cut in phosphorus runoff into the lake by 2015. They are developing plans to meet the goal, focusing primarily on preventing overflows from municipal sewage treatment plants and encouraging farmers to use practices that prevent manure and fertilizers from flowing into tributary rivers. A finding that a water body is impaired can lead to a federal order for stricter pollution controls. Such controls include a maximum amount of a contaminant that can exist in the water and regulation of industries and others that cause the pollution. But for now, Michigan officials are not developing such a plan, known as a “Total Maximum Daily Load” or TMDL blueprint. Instead, they will ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to give the agreement between the two states and Ontario time to work. “We are always looking for more collaborative, voluntary approaches to trying to solve these problems,” Grether said. She said using a TMDL would be “like taking a sledgehammer when you might need a pencil.” The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s campaign for voluntary farm measures — such as planting strips of vegetation between croplands and waterways to prevent erosion — is getting results, according to the agency’s director, Jamie Clover Adams. She credited that approach with a sharp drop of phosphorus levels in the River Raisin in southeastern Michigan, a Lake Erie tributary. “While it is true that River Raisin's total phosphorus levels have fallen, the amounts of a subset of total phosphorus called dissolved reactive phosphorus have more than doubled over the same time period,” Taylor said in her email. “It is dissolved reactive phosphorus, not total phosphorus, which feeds the cyanobacteria. Ms. Clover-Adams’ comments about total phosphorus in the Raisin, while true, have nothing to do with the cyanobacteria that produces the microcystin toxin.” Some scientists and environmental advocates contend farm programs won’t be enough to solve the algae problem unless all farms are required to participate. Still, Michigan’s impaired-water designation under the Clean Water Act is “a crucial and encouraging first step” because it makes a cleanup enforceable under federal law, said Mike Shriberg, Great Lakes regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation. “Today’s action needs to be a catalyst for the U.S. EPA and states of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana to act with urgency to craft and implement a pollution-reduction plan that protects our waters from harmful algal blooms,” Shriberg said. A farm group said the designation was unnecessary and wouldn’t solve the algae problem. “Instead of encouraging constructive solutions, today’s announcement sets the table for even more government mandates, largely driven by fringe groups out to dismantle Michigan agriculture,” said Jim Byrum, president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

 A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention. <p>A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention.</p> A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention. Researchers found that nearly 10,000 metric tons — or 22 million pounds — of plastic debris enter the Great Lakes every year from the United States and Canada. Matthew Hoffman, assistant professor in RIT’s School of Mathematical Sciences, is the lead author of “Inventory and Transport of Plastic Debris in the Laurentian Great Lakes,” which will run in an upcoming issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin. “This study is the first picture of the true scale of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes,” Hoffman said. Hoffman used computer simulations to follow the volume of plastic debris moving across state and international boundaries — from Illinois to Michigan and from Canada to the United States. Earlier studies estimate 40,000 to 110,000 metric tons of plastics enter the oceans along the U.S. coastline, he said. In their study, Hoffman and co-author Eric Hittinger, assistant professor of public policy at RIT, report that half of the plastic pollution entering the Great Lakes — 5,000 metrics tons a year — goes into Lake Michigan, followed by Lake Erie with 2,500 metric tons and Lake Ontario with 1,400 metric tons. Lake Huron receives 600 metric tons of plastic and Lake Superior, 32 metric tons a year. Estimates of surface microplastics entering the lakes each year show 4.41 metric tons in Lake Erie, 1.44 metric tons in Lake Huron and .0211 metric ton in Lake Superior. Plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is approximately the equivalent of 100 Olympic-sized pools full of plastic bottles dumped into the lake every year, Hittinger said, whereas the yearly amount of plastic in Lake Ontario equates to 28 Olympic-sized pools full of plastic bottles. Prior observational studies measured localized concentrations of plastic pollution in the open water, tributaries and along the shorelines. The new study applied mathematical modeling for the first time to extend the scope of the problem over time and spatial scales. The inventory gives full mass estimates on the entire connected lake system and maps plastic debris moving between lakes and across interstate and international borders. The results provide environmentally realistic concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes. Findings of the study show debris travels differently in the Great Lakes than in the ocean. Instead of the floating “garbage patches” found in the ocean, plastic in the Great Lakes is carried by persistent winds and lake currents to the shore — often washing up in another state or country, Hoffman said. Plastic accounts for about 80 percent of the litter on the shorelines of the Great Lakes. The study quantifies dense plastic that quickly sinks and surface plastics like microbeads, fragments and pellets, plastic line and Styrofoam, which could be consumed by wildlife and potentially enter the food chain. Major population centers are the primary sources of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes system, with Chicago, Toronto, Cleveland and Detroit releasing more plastic particles than accumulate on their shorelines. “Most of the particles from Chicago and Milwaukee end up accumulating on the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, while the particles from Detroit and Cleveland end up along the southern coast of the eastern basin of Lake Erie,” Hoffman said. “Particles released from Toronto appear to accumulate on the southern coast of Lake Ontario, including around Rochester and Sodus Bay,” he said. Estimates of plastic pollution throughout the Great Lakes were derived using population dynamics within 62 miles of the shores and hydrodynamic modeling to simulate the distribution of plastic debris throughout the Great Lakes from 2009 to 2014. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Coastal Forecast System were used to simulate currents transporting plastic debris throughout the lake system.

 Officials say state testing showed contaminant found in surface water but not in village's drinking water <p>DEERFIELD — Possible PFOS contamination was found at the intake of the Deerfield Water Filtration Plant, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.</p> DEERFIELD — Possible PFOS contamination was found at the intake of the Deerfield Water Filtration Plant, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. EGLE notified state legislators and local officials Friday night that evidence of possible perfluorooctane sulfonic acids (PFOS) were found at the intake of the Deerfield plant. Monthly testing of surface water detected PFOS on July 29. However, drinking water treated at the plant showed no detections. The agency said there is no data suggesting drinking water has been compromised. PFOS are man-made chemicals used in industrial and consumer products such as carpet and clothing treatments as well as firefighting foams, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The chemicals can have potentially adverse effects on human health and the environment because of their toxicity. They are resistant to environmental degradation processes. Further testing upstream and downstream will continue. EGLE will also retest drinking water in Deerfield, Adrian, Blissfield, Frenchtown and Monroe. Those water systems were tested last year for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and showed no "significant contamination," according to a news release. Public water systems are tested by EGLE on a monthly basis. State legislators Rep. Bronna Kahle, R-Adrian, and Sen. Dale Zorn, R-Ida, both issued statements regarding EGLE's find and pledged to release more information when it becomes available. "Deerfield is fortunate to have a municipal water filtration system that removes such chemicals,” Zorn said in a statement. “However, municipal water plants upstream and downstream of the River Raisin should have an aggressive investigation to locate the cause. I will continue to monitor EGLE with daily briefings.” The state created the PFAS Action Response Team in 2017 to find and manage the presence of PFAS chemicals. Earlier this summer, Kahle was part of a bipartisan group of legislators that introduced reforms to the state's PFAS/PFOS testing and response system. “PFAS and PFOS contamination is still an emerging issue around Michigan, and state officials are still learning all they can,” Kahle said in a statement. “We have made progress in the last couple of years funding research surveys and advanced testing, and I am glad to see officials were able to find this contamination before it got into our drinking water. But today is a reminder there is no such thing as good enough. We can and will do more to find PFAS and PFOS in our area and protect local residents from these harmful chemicals.” Residents can contact Kahle at 517-373-1706 or by email at BronnaKahle@House. MI.gov and Zorn at 517-373-3543 or by email at SenDZorn@Senate. Michigan.gov. EGLE can be contacted 800-662-9278 or by email at EGLE-Assist@Michigan.gov.

 That torrent is poisoning aquatic life and tainting drinking water sources in Montana, California, Colorado, Oklahoma and at least five other states. <p>RIMINI, Mont. — Every day many millions of gallons of water loaded with arsenic, lead and other toxic metals flow from some of the most contaminated mining sites in the U.S. and into surrounding streams and ponds without being treated, The Associated Press has found.</p> RIMINI, Mont. — Every day many millions of gallons of water loaded with arsenic, lead and other toxic metals flow from some of the most contaminated mining sites in the U.S. and into surrounding streams and ponds without being treated, The Associated Press has found. That torrent is poisoning aquatic life and tainting drinking water sources in Montana, California, Colorado, Oklahoma and at least five other states. The pollution is a legacy of how the mining industry was allowed to operate in the U.S. for more than a century. Companies that built mines for silver, lead, gold and other "hardrock" minerals could move on once they were no longer profitable, leaving behind tainted water that still leaks out of the mines or is cleaned up at taxpayer expense. Using data from public records requests and independent researchers, the AP examined 43 mining sites under federal oversight, some containing dozens or even hundreds of individual mines. The records show that at average flows, more than 50 million gallons of contaminated wastewater streams daily from the sites. In many cases, it runs untreated into nearby groundwater, rivers and ponds — a roughly 20-million-gallon daily dose of pollution that could fill more than 2,000 tanker trucks. The remainder of the waste is captured or treated in a costly effort that will need to carry on indefinitely, for perhaps thousands of years, often with little hope for reimbursement. The volumes vastly exceed the release from Colorado's Gold King Mine disaster in 2015, when a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup crew inadvertently triggered the release of 3 million gallons of mustard-colored mine sludge, fouling rivers in three states. At many mines, the pollution has continued decades after their enlistment in the federal Superfund cleanup program for the nation's most hazardous sites, which faces sharp cuts under President Donald Trump. Federal officials fear that at least six of the sites examined by AP could have blowouts like the one at Gold King. Some sites feature massive piles or impoundments of mine waste known as tailings. A tailings dam collapse in Brazil last month killed at least 169 people and left 140 missing. A similar 2014 accident in British Columbia swept millions of cubic yards of contaminated mud into a nearby lake, resulting in one of Canada's worst environmental disasters. But even short of a calamitous accident, many mines pose the chronic problem of relentless pollution. TAINTED WELLS In mountains outside the Montana capital of Helena, about 30 households can't drink their tap water because groundwater was polluted by about 150 abandoned gold, lead and copper mines that operated from the 1870s until 1953. The community of Rimini was added to the Superfund list in 1999. Contaminated soil in residents' yards was replaced, and the EPA has provided bottled water for a decade. But polluted water still pours from the mines and into Upper Tenmile Creek. "The fact that bottled water is provided is great," said 30-year Rimini resident Catherine Maynard, a natural resources analyst for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. "Where it falls short is it's not piped into our home. Water that's piped into our home is still contaminated water. Washing dishes and bathing — that metal-laden water is still running through our pipes." Estimates of the number of such abandoned mine sites range from 161,000 in 12 western states to as many as 500,000 nationwide. At least 33,000 have degraded the environment, according to the Government Accountability Office, and thousands more are discovered every year. Officials have yet to complete work including basic risk analyses on about 80 percent of abandoned mining sites on federal lands. Most are controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, which under Trump is seeking to consolidate mine cleanups with another program and cut their combined 2019 spending from $35 million to $13 million. PERPETUAL POLLUTION Problems at some sites are intractable. Among them: • In eastern Oklahoma's Tar Creek mining district, waterways are devoid of life and elevated lead levels persist in the blood of children despite a two-decade effort to clean up lead and zinc mines. More than $300 million has been committed since 1983, but only a small fraction of the impacted land has been reclaimed and contaminated water continues to flow. • At northern California's Iron Mountain Mine, cleanup teams battle to contain highly acidic water that percolates through a former copper and zinc mine and drains into a Sacramento River tributary. The mine discharged six tons of toxic sludge daily before an EPA cleanup. Authorities now spend $5 million a year to remove poisonous sludge that had caused massive fish kills, and they expect to keep at it forever. • In Colorado's San Juan Mountains, site of the Gold King blowout, some 400 abandoned or inactive mine sites contribute an estimated 15 million gallons of acid mine drainage per day. This landscape of polluted sites occurred under mining industry rules largely unchanged since the 1872 Mining Act. State and federal laws in recent decades have held companies more accountable than in the past, but critics say huge loopholes all but ensure that some of today's mines will foul waterways or require perpetual cleanups. To avoid a catastrophe like Gold King, EPA officials now require advance approval for work on many mining sites. But they acknowledge they're only dealing with a small portion of the problem. "We have been trying to play a very careful game of prioritization," said Dana Stalcup, deputy director of the Superfund program. "We know the Superfund program is not the answer to the hundreds of thousands of mines out there, but the mines we are working on we want to do them the best we can." The 43 sites examined by AP are ones where officials and researchers have reliable estimates of polluted water releases. Officials say flow rates vary, and the AP used low flow data for several sites where average flows were not available. QUESTIONS OVER WHO SHOULD PAY To date, the EPA has spent an estimated $4 billion on mining cleanups. Under Trump, the agency has identified a small number of Superfund sites for heightened attention after cleanup efforts stalled or dragged on for years. They include five mining sites examined by AP. Former EPA assistant administrator Mathy Stanislaus said more money is needed to address mining pollution on a systematic basis, rather than jumping from one emergency response to another. "The piecemeal approach is just not working," said Stanislaus, who oversaw the Superfund program for almost eight years ending in 2017. Democrats have sought unsuccessfully to create a special cleanup fund for old hardrock mine sites, with fees paid by the mining industry. Such a fund has been in place for coal mines since 1977, with more than $11 billion in fees collected and hundreds of sites reclaimed. The mining industry has resisted doing the same for hardrock mines, and Republicans in Congress have blocked the Democratic proposals. Montana Mining Association director Tammy Johnson acknowledged abandoned mines have left a legacy of pollution, but added that companies still in operation should not be forced to pay for those problems. "Back in the day there really wasn't a lot known about acid mine drainage," she said. "I just don't think that today's companies bear the responsibility." In 2017, the EPA proposed requiring companies still operating mines to post cleanup bonds or offer other financial assurances so taxpayers don't end up footing cleanup bills. The Trump administration halted the rule, but environmental groups are scheduled to appear in federal court next month in a lawsuit that seeks to revive it. "When something gets on a Superfund site, that doesn't mean it instantly and magically gets cleaned up," said Earthjustice attorney Amanda Goodin. " Having money immediately available from a responsible party would be a game changer."

 Data from last summer shows 12 of the 13 upstream tributaries of the Pine River contaminated with E. coli bacteria. The Healthy Pine River citizens group will hear the data explained at a meeting at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Alma Public Library. The public is invited. Senior Aquatic Biologist Molly Rippke of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality will speak about the sampling project conducted by MDEQ last summer. Her presentation will explain the results, and there will be questions and answers afterwards. Streams that flow into both the Pine and Chippewa rivers were sampled in July and August to help determine the sources of the bacterial contamination. Streams sampled were in Mecosta, Isabella and Gratiot counties. DNA analysis of the samples is under way at a bacteriological research lab at Saginaw Valley State University. The analysis will determine if the E. coli bacteria are human are bovine. "We expect to see both," said Gary Rayburn, chair of the Healthy Pine River group. "We know there are leaking septic tanks along the river, and our group is working to address that issue. We also know that agricultural runoff is a big problem in our county with 23 CAFOs and other large farms located here." The Mid-Michigan District Health Department determined two summers ago that signs should be put up warning people about the contaminants in the river to help prevent illnesses caused by E. coli and other bacteria present in the Pine River. There are signs in Alma and Arcada Township at access points near the river.

 <i>Colonie</i> People in Cohoes and Colonie likely were not at risk when their Mohawk River drinking water supply was tainted by a massive eight-day raw sewage spill upriver in Amsterdam two winters ago, but it's not possible to know for certain, according to local officials who learned of the episode this week. The 24-million-gallon spill happened in December 2013, but came to light publicly only this week when the state A 2013 state law that requires sewer plant operators to inform both the state and local officials of sewage spills failed to result in alerts to such officials in both Montgomery County and the Capital Region. The Mohawk River sewage spill was one of the largest for the river in memory. Tens of thousands of people in Colonie and Cohoes rely on the river for drinking water. On Tuesday, Amsterdam Mayor Under the 2013 state Sewage Right to Know Law, sewer plant operators must report spills within two hours to DEC and within four hours to "the public and adjoining municipalities" so local officials and the public have a chance to react quickly rather than remain unaware. On Monday, the DEC blamed the failure to inform local officials on a form filled out improperly by Amsterdam officials to report the spill, which ran from Dec. 12 to 20 after two pumping stations failed and poured untreated sewage directly into the river. Thane added, "At the time, we were fully in compliance with what was expected of us. DEC was and is responsible for the notifications of the downstream users. We are hopeful that they did their due diligence and made the proper notifications in December of 2013. City officials would not know who to contact downstream." Asked about Thane's statement, the Meanwhile, water system officials in Colonie and Cohoes expressed concern over the notification failure while also seeking to allay concerns over potential drinking water safety. "I want the public to know that we have multiple barriers in our water treatment plant, including disinfectant at the end," said Frazer said if he had received notice of the sewage spill he would have increased contaminant monitoring at the drinking water intakes to see if treatment methods needed adjustment. He added that the health risk was likely low because the sewage had been diluted by the time it reached Colonie's water intakes. Amsterdam is about 30 miles upriver. "I'd like to say that everything was OK back then, but we have no way of knowing for certain if there was an impact," said The A report form filed by the city with the DEC — and provided to the An online DEC annual sewage spill summary report required under the law also failed to note the Amsterdam spill. That report indicated that about 17.4 million gallons of untreated sewage spilled in multiple cases statewide in 2013; that total is much less than the Amsterdam spill by itself. Asked by the Times Union to explain the apparent discrepancy, the DEC press office said a state form used by Amsterdam to report the spill on Dec. 12 showed the amount of the spill as blank because that amount had been filled out as "24 mil" and not 24,000,000. "The data for this incident has now been corrected and will display as '24,000,000,'" according to a DEC statement this week. DEC now uses the NY Alert email system to report sewage spills, but it was not using this system when the new spill reporting law went into effect in May 2013. " Further instances of this type are not expected because information is now being more accurately captured through the NY Alert reporting system," according to DEC. Under the DEC agreement signed April 14 by Thane, the city agreed to pay a $13,750 fine for violations of the U.S. Clean Water Act and to have upgraded its sewers by 2017 to reduce the risk of sewage spills during periods of heavy rain. The state agreement made no mention of any potential violation of the Sewage Right to Know law. The DEC agreement requires the city to begin tracking the amount of untreated sewage that escapes into the river when it rains, which causes the sewer system to be overwhelmed. The city also must file an inventory of sewer infrastructure and a capital spending plan for how the system can be made to operate within water pollution limits. The agreement is the second time the city has been fined for its sewers polluting the river. In 2010, the city was fined $5,700 by DEC and agreed to upgrade its equipment. That agreement is now part of the latest agreement. < i><a href="mailto:bnearing@timesunion.com">bnearing@timesunion.com</a></i>

 Caption Close EAST HAMPTON > > Sears Point Beach has been closed after potentially unsafe levels of cyanobacteria were found during water testing. Town officials notified residents of the closure via a reverse 911 system Monday morning. But, the state-recognized safe level is defined as 100,000 parts per milliliter, he said. The town has been closely monitoring bacteria levels in the lake water for the past two weeks. Town Manager Michael Maniscalco said state law requires municipal-owned beaches be closed when the 100,000 level is exceeded. When there is a potential for residents (and visitors) to become ill from ingesting the contaminated water, “We have to be prudent,” Maniscalco said Monday afternoon. There is nothing to prevent people who own a dock on the lake from diving into or swimming in the lake, Maniscalco said. However, “because we operate a municipally owned beach, we have a greater responsibility to the public at large.” Cyanobacteria — blue-green algae — is a naturally occurring phenomenon “in lakes and ponds throughout Connecticut,” according to an advisory from the state Department of Public Health. The microscopic organisms are “part of the aquatic food chain,” according to “However, warmer water temperatures and high nutrient concentrations may induce a rapid increase in their abundance and that rapid increase can create “a bloom,” the guidance notes. “When the microorganisms die, they release toxins” that can result in “skin irritation and rashes,” Mitchell said. If contaminated water is ingested, the toxins can cause intestinal disorders. What’s more, “potent liver toxins” are also found in the bloom, DPH notes. The decision to use the reverse 911 system to notify residents offered the best option to make as many people as possible aware of the closure in the shortest time possible. Posting signs or issuing an email notice would not have had the same effect, the manager said. “Our goal was for our residents to have as much as information as possible as quickly as possible so they could make an informed decision” about whether to use the lake, Maniscalco said. Maniscalco said the town will continue to monitor water quality. “We have to have two consecutive readings of less than 100,000 parts per milliliter before the beach can safely be reopened for public use.” The problem of algae bloom is the result, in part, of water temperatures and also by the lack of rain, which can dilute the algae blooms. However, as Mitchell explained late last month, rain is a double-edged sword. One of the most significant causes of algae blooms is fertilizer runoff carried into the lake by rain, Mitchell said. Nutrients in common fertilizers fuel the growth of algae blooms, he added.

 Caption Close Bacteria found in floodwaters pose a major threat to residents of hard-hit areas looking to re-enter their homes in the aftermath of Harvey, officials said Wednesday. City leaders and doctors warn high levels of E. coli and other bacteria could linger on items exposed to standing floodwater, making it dangerous for homeowners in neighborhoods like Bevil Oaks, Northwest Forest and Pinewood Estates to begin cleanup. <strong>&gt; &gt ; Harvey Rumors Debunked:</strong> Dr. Jana Winberg, health authority for Hardin County, said that while the county has performed no tests, officials are concerned that floodwaters were contaminated with E. coli. "Because we have septic systems that have flooded, the concern is that there is E. coli and other bacteria that you would find in stool in the flood water," Winberg said. "The risk for that is going to be skin infection." Sour Lake Volunteer Fire Department Chief Glen Withers said initial tests by the city showed a significant amount of E. coli and other bacteria in the floodwater. "This isn't uncommon during floods and it isn't unique to us (Sour Lake)," Withers said. "I can't speak for everyone else, but we have it here." In Bevil Oaks, Fire Chief Chris Gonzales said tests have yet to be run, but he expects the floodwater to contain contaminants. "There is absolutely a potential," Gonzalez said. "As the water comes up, it gets things mixed in with it. There could be fuel from garages, dead cattle, anything really. So yes, people need to be very careful about what they're getting into." Winberg said some residents have asked about tetanus shots. She said people who have had one in the past 10 years should be fine. The shot is advised for others. The two most common types of infections to surface after floods are intestinal and skin infections, said Cindy Powers, director of Infection Control for Christus St. Elizabeth Hospital. "Floodwater is floodwater, and people need to take the same precaution with all of it," Powers said. "If you're in an area with a lot of septic tanks, you're going to have sewage in the floodwater. If you're downstream from that, you could get contaminated water as well." Powers said the best way to avoid infection is to stay out of floodwater completely. If contact with items exposed to floodwater is absolutely necessary, masks, boots, gloves and heavy clothing are strongly recommended. Wounds should not come in contact with floodwater under any circumstance, she said. Dr. George Davis, an emergency medicine physician at Christus St. Elizabeth Hospital, said he has treated multiple patients with infections he believes to be caused by bacteria from Harvey floodwaters. It's a problem he doesn't expect will go away soon. "We're going to have prolonged exposure to bacteria as people try to get back to their homes," Davis said. "We almost have to treat it like a missions trip because it's so unprecedented." Davis said he has seen mobile units set up near heavily flooded areas to help treat those believed to be infected. Symptoms of intestinal infections include uncontrollable vomiting, diarrhea lasting longer than 12 hours and a high fever. Infected wounds will begin to turn red and leak fluid. Neil Burrell noticed those symptoms after he recently waded through floodwater. Burrell, also a doctor, was attempting to get supplies to diabetics in need when he believes he contracted an intestinal infection. He was admitted to Christus St. Elizabeth on Wednesday morning, treated, then released later in the afternoon. Burrell said he was lucky to catch the symptoms early before the infection became problematic. "Most people are trying to be careful but don't necessarily realize the seriousness of it," Burrell said. "A little illness like this can be catastrophic if you don't treat it."

 Even before flood waters recede from Central California farms and communities, disaster experts are assessing the possible public health threat posed by drowned cattle, contaminated wells and sunken barns filled with pesticides and fertilizer. For the most part, county health officials say, it is just too early to tell how big the problem will be. Although there are widespread reports of missing livestock, for example, few animal carcasses have been recovered. Meanwhile, California Department of "If a delta island floods, particularly a large delta island, it potentially pulls salt water in from San Francisco Bay," Water Resources scientist However, according to a Water Resources spokesman, there are no indications yet that the flooding Sacramento, San Joaquin and Cosumnes rivers will cause this kind of damage. The most feared scenario threatening the integrity of the delta water system is not major storm flooding, but an earthquake. The floods have already created some less spectacular but very real health hazards. In Modesto, weekend flood waters overwhelmed a sewage treatment plant, contaminating the waters downstream in the swollen Tuolumne River. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Gordon+Dewers%22">Gordon Dewers</a> The biggest threat is Hepatitis A, an acute inflammation of the liver, said "The most important safeguard is frequent and routine handwashing with soap and water," Courtney said. "People need to pay particular attention to handling of articles that may have been contaminated with sewage." The county has procured a supply of gamma globulin shots for those who have gotten sewage-contaminated water in their mouths. In waterlogged Yuba County, health officers are still trying to assess the severity of the problem. "We have a 16- square-mile lake, where water is as deep as 30 to 40 feet," said The county has rescued about 2,500 animals, ranging from dogs and cats to sheep, goats and cows.

 Caption Close Drug dealer, hippie, venture capitalist, mining executive. One of the most controversial promoters of junior mining stocks is Now an international mining executive with dual U.S.-Canadian citizenship after cashing in on one of the world's largest nickel deposits, Friedland recently settled a running legal battle with U.S. authorities, agreeing to pay $27.75 million toward the $232 million cleanup of a Colorado gold mine built by one of his companies. It was not Friedland's first brush with legal authorities. He ran afoul of the law much earlier in his life. While attending Friedland told the judge it was unfair to sentence him until the judge himself had tried the drug. "You gave no thought to the consequences for others that could have resulted from this transaction," the judge responded, "but only to the large sum of money that you could have obtained." After serving a brief prison sentence -- the conviction was later expunged from his record -- Friedland headed to In the late 1970s, after graduating from Reed with a degree in political science, Friedland got interested in gold mining, though the exact origins of his gold fever remain unclear. After reportedly living for a time in Seattle, he went farther north to strike it rich -- on the Most Vancouver exchange stock promoters "dismissed him as a Jesus look-alike who preached about gold as though it was the second coming," Friedland did get help from an experienced broker, however. Using a classic Vancouver Stock Exchange strategy, they revived a defunct company, Galactic Resources, and began to look for investors. Galactic, using a series of subsidiaries, launched a gold mine in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado and ran it from the mid-1980s until 1992. It was called Summitville. Problems quickly cropped up. Even The Northern Miner, an industry publication that defends Friedland, termed the construction "hurried and bungled." Within days, cyanide leaked through a liner and into the ground. Rocks that were uncovered to get at the gold were exposed to rain and snow, generating acidic runoff. In the summer of 1987, about 85,000 gallons of cyanide-tainted water poured into Cropsy Creek, one in a series of spills that resulted in numerous citations. The nearby Alamosa River was so polluted it could not support fish. "A case study of what can go wrong at a mine site," a government-commissioned report would later conclude. The state slapped Friedland's company with $131,850 in fines, but the company took more than $130 million in gold in the years after the leaks were detected. Friedland resigned from the company in November 1990, selling his shares, he says, at "a substantial personal financial loss." Two years later, a Galactic subsidiary filed for bankruptcy and abandoned the Colorado mine. Environmentalists took to calling Friedland "Toxic Bob." Today, Colorado and the federal government have spent about $180 million cleaning up the mess. Regulators reckon it will cost at least an additional $52 million to finish the job. Although he and his Galactic investors had lost millions, Friedland was undaunted. He raised a new batch of money in Vancouver for several corporations, including one he called Diamond Fields Resources. He started looking for diamonds in the United States, Canada and Africa. Friedland's company financed one diamond hunt in Labrador, Newfoundland, but the geologists instead found nickel -- one of the largest deposits ever uncovered. Friedland received an estimated $400 million in stock when Diamond Fields was sold to Friedland, who is said to have a net worth estimated at $640 million, soon set his sights on South America and Asia, and moved his base of operations to Singapore. U.S. authorities, seeking reimbursement for their costs in the Summitville cleanup, persuaded a Canadian judge to freeze $152 million of Friedland's assets there. But the judge later unfroze the assets, scolding U.S. prosecutors for misleading the court by, among other things, failing to reveal that Friedland several years earlier had offered to pay part of the cleanup costs for Summitville. The government alleges that Friedland rushed in order to meet a production schedule he promised his lenders, leading to a botched midwinter construction job that led to a leaky liner that allowed cyanide to escape at Summitville. "We think he's liable under the Superfund act," said Friedland has not been available for comment for this article. In an affidavit filed in the Summitville case, he said, "I was the chief A junior engineer working for a firm hired by Friedland's company testified that he had told Friedland about the problems within weeks of their discovery, and that Friedland admitted he had made a mistake by promising to build the mine during the brutal Colorado winter. Friedland denies saying this. Instead, Friedland says, he hired some of the best people in the business to build and operate the mine. Friedland says Galactic went broke trying to meet Colorado water-quality standards that are "impractical if not impossible." Friedland says his lawyers had years before started talking to government lawyers about the possibility that he would help pay for the cleanup -- but without admitting any blame. "I have been falsely portrayed by the U.S. government as some sort of rogue who has fled from justice and the sort of person who will ignore his financial obligations and defraud his creditors," Friedland said in a 1996 affidavit. He also has pointed out that the whole Summitville mining district was mined for about a century before Galactic's arrival and that much of the acid drainage was from old workings. And he has been quick to criticize the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup, which has not gone well. The Auditors also criticized a cleanup contractor for obtaining EPA money "without adequate supporting documentation to ensure costs were allowable and reasonable." A principal in the same firm was indicted in Kentucky last year on charges of racketeering, mail fraud and wire fraud unrelated to the Summitville mine. He pleaded guilty in March of this year to obstruction of justice. Friedland's lawyers alleged in court papers that about $75 million of the Summitville cleanup costs resulted from "outright fraud, bid-rigging, billing irregularities" and other problems. The government responded by reducing its request for reimbursement from $130 million to $41 million, and settling for $27.75 million to be paid over a decade. For his part, Friedland, 50, shows no signs of slowing down. Now living in Hong Kong, he has used his Ivanhoe Capital Corp. and related companies to set up mining ventures in South America, Asia and Africa, and he is branching out into high technology and real estate. In 1996, he was honored as mining developer of the Year by the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada.

 ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — State environmental officials are trying to determine whether the water in a North Slope Borough village is safe to drink after reports that industrial drums were found in the town's water source. David Fauske, a spokesman for the borough, said there are several holding tanks of drinking water available for Point Lay residents and that the borough is considering building a pipeline to a new drinking water source. "In response to community concerns that the water supply for the village of Point Lay may be contaminated, the North Slope Borough is taking immediate action to establish an alternative water supply for the community as investigators work to pinpoint and identify possible contaminants," Fauske told KTUU-TV ( Candice Bressler, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, said the agency received an anonymous report about potential water contamination and that what appears to be drums have found been in the lake where Point Lay gets its drinking water. "If the report is confirmed, then we would mobilize and work on identifying the responsible party," Bressler said. State environmental officials said the village's public drinking water system is owned and operated by the North Slope Borough and is required to undergo regular testing. "The borough's first and foremost responsibility is to ensure the health and safety of its residents and is taking these concerns very seriously. Additional information will be distributed to the impacted community and general public as soon as it becomes available," Fauske said.

 <strong>1997-11-02 04:00:00 PDT SHASTA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA</strong> It's a virulent polluter, this acid drainage from Iron Mountain Mine nine miles north of Redding. The largest mine in California, it's been poisoning salmon and other downstream fish as far away as San Francisco for a century. Scientists link higher amounts of copper in clams 200 miles away in San Francisco Bay to discharge from Iron Mountain. The mine dumps an average of 180 pounds of copper daily to the Sacramento River near Lake Shasta. By comparison, all the factories and sewage treatment plants around the Bay together are allowed to dump only an average of 55 pounds a day, because copper is so toxic to plants and animals at the base of the food web. Yet, some call Iron Mountain Mine a Superfund success story - thanks to the way the Environmental Protection Agency used the federal Three years ago, the Now the giant chemical company deemed responsible by the EPA for cleaning up this most concentrated acid mine drainage on earth is asking a federal court judge to rule that the government should bear the cost. If it prevails, California taxpayers' share of the mine cleanup bill would total $9 billion, not counting inflation. It's part of a new legal strategy from companies that have spent tens of millions of dollars fighting Superfund cleanup orders. Rhone Poulenc, the multinational firm ordered to pay Iron Mountain cleanup costs, is one of dozens of corporations seeking to turn the nation's hazardous-waste cleanup program on its head. In the last five years, some federal judges have ruled in their favor. The government had a role in the pollution, either by purchasing the mine's product or through acts of its own upstream, U.S. District Court Judge "This case has a long way to go," cautioned Rhone Poulenc - 12 percent owned by the French government - seeks to recover $104 million it claims to have spent at Iron Mountain, including the cost of building the multimillion dollar treatment plant in 1994. It also wants the state to pay for perpetual cleanup at a cost of $3-4 million a year. Environmentalist "These companies boggle the process," Gibbs said. "They do that by hiring lots of lawyers. . .who find a whole lot of reasons why they couldn't pay. They muddy the waters. They know the suits that they file against the EPA and the state will go nowhere and are unlikely to win. They know it makes everybody nervous, and costs everybody money. Even though the suit has no merit, someone has to write up court documents. Someone needs to go to court and defend." What happens in the Iron Mountain Mine case could open up routes for other companies fighting Superfund cleanup orders, U.S. "We're seeing it more and more," said Bloomfield of the EPA. "Companies are countersuing, and trying to make the federal or state government liable or lessen their own liability or persuade the government to pick a less expensive cleanup." <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Richard+Lazarus%22">Richard Lazarus</a> In the 1980s and early 1990s, the government successfully argued that the Superfund law holds current and previous owners and dumpers liable for cleaning up active and abandoned hazardous-waste sites, said Lazarus. "One by one, the defendants lost virtually all of these cases," he said. But having failed in the courts to change Superfund and having failed in Congress to amend it, the companies now are trying to argue that the government, by its actions at a site, should share in the liability, Lazarus said. "In the last few years," said Lazarus, "industry has started to win." In a hot Sacramento courtroom last July, eight lawyers in dark pin-striped suits lined up to present arguments for Rhone Poulenc. On the other side, two Department of Justice lawyers and two EPA lawyers stood for the federal government. A deputy attorney general sat ready to protect the interests of the State of California. Rhone Poulenc, which says it's spent $16 million on legal fees in the last seven years on this matter, has already raised at least 21 defenses and dozens of counterclaims to the EPA's demand that it pay for the cleanup. On this day, The EPA is "spending our money like drunken sailors," said Galvani, who represents at least five other sites on the Superfund list for his firm, Ropes and Gray. For Rhone Poulenc, Galvani and his platoon of assistants claim that the U.S. government should share cleanup costs. Among their reasons: * EPA's solutions exacerbated the problem and cost too much. * Shasta Dam, built by the * The government bought metals from the mine during World War II and were on the site, and thus had a role in the pollution. The EPA responds that just being a consumer of the metals mined at Iron Mountain does not make the government responsible for the pollution. There would have to be some actual control over the mine or a sharing in profits. EPA lawyers say Shasta Dam doesn't cause pollution and points to massive fish poisonings caused by Iron Mountain long before the reservoir was built. "The defendants are always looking for defenses. As the case law develops, then they decide on which ones to move forward," said <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Peter+Taft%22">Peter Taft</a> Shell Oil, Arco, "We spent a lot of money," Taft said, "but we saved more than we spent." In the glaring sunlight up at Iron Mountain Mine, state biologist "Even I can smell that," said Heiman, inured to the acrid odor of mine drainage but reacting to sulfur fumes from the copper-rich turquoise pools. When rain water hits pyrite ore, it forms sulfuric acid, which leaches out copper and other metals. Heiman has been coming to Iron Mountain for the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board in Redding for seven years. His colleague, Bureaucrats, including From Redding, they can see what looks like a 100-story rock dump. That's Iron Mountain Mine. Waste piles, iron-stained rocks and scattered mining debris litter the 4,400 acres. Hidden below the surface is a network of tunnels and chambers, now collapsed. The Richmond mine alone, one of four big ones, is like a buried city. "Imagine yourself in downtown San Francisco, and you've got 20 office buildings between 10 and 20 stories high. That's what they've carved out underground," said Sugarek, EPA project manager at the mine. " After mining, they allowed the rocks to fall in. So you have a rubblized zone in the mountain that's 70 stories high and covers the footprint of the office buildings. The water filters through this broken up pyrite deposit, just like a big Mr. Coffee, and forms a highly concentrated mine drainage." On the surface, lies the apparatus aimed at stemming the pollution - a sludge-drying plant, a treatment plant with a settling pond as big as an Olympic swimming pool and a sludge dump. The state ordered its first enforcement action against the mine in 1976, the same year then-owner Stauffer Chemical was on the verge of selling to Sacramento businessman "We were informed that they were going to sell it to a man who didn't have much money," said state biologist Pedri. "We issued an order to Stauffer Chemical, telling them to clean up and abate the effects of acid mine drainage on the property. It's still in effect." Arman bought it. "They didn't privy me to any of the environmental problems although we were a year in negotiations," he says. "That's where my "innocent landowner' defense comes. Stauffer didn't tell me until six months after I bought the property. Then I learned the environmental problems had gone on for years. I would never have bought it." The EPA put the mine on its National Priorities List in 1983, calling it one of the worst hazardous waste sites in the nation. But Arman didn't have the money to pay for cleanup. EPA lawyers cast an eye on the former owner, Stauffer Chemical. In the meantime, Rhone Poulenc had purchased Stauffer Chemical and become its successor, thus - in EPA eyes - assuming responsibility for the mine. EPA lawyer, Bloomfield, said, "One of the main principles of Superfund is that the polluter pays rather than the taxpayer. The company that benefitted from the polluting activity should be responsible for cleaning up." Rhone Poulenc told the court it wasn't liable for pollution by those who mined the mountain, but in September, Judge Levi ruled for the government, declaring Rhone Poulenc the successor to the original mining company, Mountain Copper, which sold to Stauffer after creating the pollution. On Wednesday, Levi ruled against Rhone Poulenc's claim that the government was partly responsible for the pollution because it built Shasta Dam and bought minerals in the 1940s. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Brian+Spiller%22">Brian Spiller</a> "The case has a long way to go yet," Spiller said, adding that Rhone Poulenc is not trying to use the courts to sink Superfund. "It's not our attempt to stretch this out. We have to respond in the detail that the court requires. . . . It looks like a lot on paper. But it's typical of any environmental case under (the Superfund law)." Downstream in the Sacramento River, nine miles below Iron Mountain Mine and 100 miles above the Sacramento courtroom, Fish and Game biologist Rectenwald crouches by the water, watching salmon circulate around gravel mounds, guarding their eggs in shallow, fast-moving riffles. Rectenwald, who grew up fishing the American River, has been on the Iron Mountain case for 12 years. He's pleased about the treatment plant built in 1994. The system, operated by Rhone Poulenc under EPA order, removes up to 80 percent of the copper, zinc, cadmium and acids. The EPA wants Rhone Poulenc to take care of most of the other 20 percent, and treat into perpetuity at a cost of about $3 million to $4 million a year. Just a month ago, the EPA ordered Rhone Poulenc to build a $21 million dam and pond on a metal-rich creek, saying the treatment would effectively end all but 5 percent of the mine's polluted drainage flowing to the Sacramento River. Even with current treatment, the Bay still gets the downstream dregs 200 miles away, said "Sometimes we feel that we're issuing jaywalking tickets in the Bay Area when there are homicides occurring just up the river," said Kolb. Copper at low levels kills species of single-celled algae, worms, insects, shrimp-like creatures and larvae of mussels and oysters that feed animals at the base of the food web, according to the San Francisco Estuary Institute. Up on the Sacramento River, Rectenwald talks about the health of the river's salmon runs. Pollution from Iron Mountain, insufficient nesting gravel and a diversion dam that keeps the fish from reaching cold water are the biggest threats to the salmon's survival in the Upper Sacramento River. Scientists say the metals can kill the young salmon. More subtly, they reduce growth and damage immune systems of adult fish, and cause them problems when they switch from fresh to salt water. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says iron mountain affects the most valuable portion of the spawning ground and calls it "one of the most significant Superfund sites in terms of its impacts on natural resources." Water project managers still fear fish kills if the Bureau of Reclamation can't release enough fresh water from Shasta Dam to dilute toxics from the mine. At times, operators dump three times the normal 5,000 cubic feet a second over 30 days - enough water to supply 2.4 million people a year - just to keep the fish alive. "We're trying to restore the river. We're trying to protect all these natural processes," Rectenwald said. "We want to keep these fish alive here and in good health, and to keep their tissue clean from contaminants. Water users are making sacrifices to solve their environmental problems. The regular waste dischargers have taken care of their effluent. So now we want to see that Iron Mountain Mine is moving ahead." During last summer's court sessions in Sacramento, Judge Levi expressed exasperation over "millions of documents that fill the corridors" - 75-page briefs, boxes of depositions and experts' reports and motions and answers to motions. The administrative record alone is 125,000 pages, the largest ever in the EPA region - four states and Pacific Island territories. Tens of thousands of those pages were produced by Rhone Poulenc, opposing EPA actions, urging less onerous remedies or requesting delays. "I wonder," said the judge, "if we gave everyone a shovel, we could just go up and clean up Iron Mountain Mine. It would save me a great deal of time. " &lt;

 Associated Press Writer A jury on Friday found that Monsanto Co. polluted the town of Anniston with PCBs _ a verdict that could expose the chemical giant to millions of dollars in damages. The amount will be determined later. Thousands more claims are pending. The verdict was the first from a jury over the PCB contamination in Anniston, but the situation has dogged Monsanto for years. The company reached a $40 million settlement in a federal case last year, and has spent tens of millions trying to clean up contamination in and around the town. Monsanto operated a plant that produced PCBs in the east Alabama town for about four decades up until the early 1970s, when the chemical was banned as a suspected cancer-causing agent. PCBs were used mainly as an insulating fluid in electrical transformers. The St. Louis-based company, its spinoff Solutia and Pharmacia Corp. were found liable Friday for negligence and other claims of 16 individuals and one business. "It's been a long time coming for someone to say Monsanto is guilty," said David Baker, a community activist who blames the companies for the death of his brother two decades ago. His case has not yet been heard by a jury. "As a child growing up in that area, the odor was so foul from the plant we had to go inside the house," he said. "People can't garden anymore. Children can't play in their yards." Circuit Judge Joel Laird said he had not decided when or how damages against the companies would be set. The judge said he would review the verdict before meeting with the jury again Monday. Chief executive John C. Hunter said Solutia was "extremely disappointed" with the verdict. "As we've said from the beginning, regardless of the result in this case, we're committed to doing what's fair to deal properly with the impacts of previous PCB production at our plant," Hunter said. Some 3,500 Anniston residents and business owners originally sued the companies, claiming Monsanto knowingly contaminated their community. Their claims will be taken up in groups, in a succession of trials. Also, a Montgomery law firm says it has about 15,000 clients suing in federal court. In Friday's case, the plaintiffs claimed the contamination from Monsanto's Anniston plant had damaged their property and caused emotional distress. Company documents were cited at trial in an attempt to show a cover-up by Monsanto officials after harm from PCBs was indicated. Besides last year's federal settlement, Solutia agreed in another case to pay $43.7 million to as many as 5,000 Anniston-area property owners along Choccolocco Creek and Lake Logan Martin, where PCBs were found. The trial was held in Gadsden, about 20 miles from the plant, because of pretrial publicity in Anniston. In the area around the Anniston plant, many homes and buildings are empty. "Most of the properties out here have negative value because it's contaminated," said Gene Tomlin, who operates Anniston Quality Meats near the chemical plant and was a plaintiff in Friday's trial. "We have pecan trees on our property and we don't allow the employees to eat the pecans." His business partner, Jimmy Curvin, said it likely will be years before they see any money. "We're hoping we get enough money to relocate and get us out of this hole," he said. _ _ _ On the Net: Monsanto: Solutia: PCB facts:

 By Samuel Shaheen I feel compelled to answer several letters to the editor and remarks by some reporters. My knowledge in the dioxin issues is of recent vintage, but it was surprising to me that in more than 50 years of medical practice I have not seen an illness that stemmed from dioxin poisoning. Since college chemistry days and biochemistry in medical school, I feel that I can read a scientific journal or article with more than average understanding. It is redundant to review the dioxin brouhaha. Instead, we should be educating ourselves in scientific fact. For more than 40 years, dioxins have been known to exist. Most scientists that I have read regard the dangers of this issue as "mass hysteria. " Dow scientists did the original work on dioxins and are probably the most knowledgeable scientists in the world on how to control the dioxin molecule. It is virtually impossible to manage molecules at parts per billion or quadrillion. The general public should be happy to have a formidable company so conscious of our environment. I would recommend "Decades of Dioxin" by Dr. Warren B. Crummett, a retired Dow scientist. This book is easy to read and explains the science of dioxins, but also points out the social and political issues that this problem has become. Much of my knowledge came from his book - after all, Dr. Crummett spent two decades with world-class scientists researching dioxins. Let the scientists tell us how to solve this problem. It is a complex problem far beyond the knowledge of lay people, politicians and bureaucrats. The most knowledgeable scientists are employed in industry. Some of the best scientific minds live in our community and don't you think they want our environment safe for their own families as well as ours? When the government becomes involved, the political implications overwhelm the scientific facts. Again, mass hysteria. How many government functions can you name that are more efficient than those run by private enterprise? An equitable combination of government and industry should be involved in vast remediation such as the Tittabawassee project, Love Canal and even a Chernobyl. Who knows who polluted our river? Was it farmer and homeowner use of pesticides; slaughterhouses and their runoff into the river? Was it forest fires, was it backyard incineration or was it countywide barbecuing, which burns fat from steaks and burgers? Was it septic tanks and animal manure flowing into the rivers? No one is denying Dow contributed to the problem. I can remember several years ago when the state mandated that Dow incinerate certain toxic chemicals. Did this contribute to the dioxin problem? If farmers and homeowners were the only pollutants, would this brouhaha be taking place? Of course not! It's Dow's deep pockets and human greed pushing this envelope. We all must admit that technology has increased and improved. We're better able to remediate our problem by decreasing the production of dioxins, but it does not mean a good corporate citizen should bear the brunt of this total cleanup. Conventional wisdom does not dictate that contaminated soils be disturbed and moved to another site. A recent report said it would take 18-20 years and millions upon millions of dollars to remediate the soil, and yet the soil never can be completely cleaned. Another question we should be asking is, why are the permissible levels of dioxins in industrialized European countries one thousand times more than in the U.S.? The only serious consequence of dioxin that I could find in the literature is chloracne, which affects people in constant contact over a prolonged period of time or exposed to large doses over a short period of time. Do you know of anyone in this area with chloracne other than some earlier Dow employees? Recently, I listened to Dr. Linda Birnbaum, a world-famous authority on dioxin, brought here at the request of the Lone Tree Council and paid by the environmentalists. She went through a litany of maladies that might be imagined complications of dioxin exposure. It was no different than reading a drug insert or reading the PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) on any drug sold through the pharmacy. If you read any drug insert, you would not take any pill. Look up aspirin or penicillin and read the complications and problems. Dr. Birnbaum had to say something to aid and abet the Lone Tree Council. The bottom line, however, was expressed at the end of her talk when she stated that she didn't think any harm would come to anyone along the river if they didn't eat the soil. The prime reason for writing this letter is to clarify my position on this subject. I have absolutely no business or personal connection or involvement with any Dow personnel other than owning Dow stock, which I purchased in the early days of my medical practice. I only know what my instincts and medical knowledge tell me. Dredging and removing soil will take 15 to 20 years and only serve to redistribute the dioxin contamination, and at an astronomical cost. The levels of dioxin are coming down. With the aid of wind, water and sun, all the toxins the world has ever produced over the years have been reduced. Sun is the strongest biodegradation force for dioxin, and nature gives us this gift. Reported environmental and body levels of dioxin have been reduced already over the past 20 years. The best scientific and financial solution for our soil contamination is to leave it alone. The removal of soil and its subsequent replacement is being out of touch with reality. It reminds me of my youth when my mother would say, "don't eat all the cookies today, there will be none left for tomorrow. " We are eating all the cookies today. What we are doing is making it more difficult to conduct business in this country. A recent Wall Street Journal article reported that more countries of the world think more highly of the socioeconomics of China than they do of the USA. Isn't that strange? There is no doubt we need to be vigilant and stewards of our environment, but not at the cost of bankrupting law-abiding companies that have given us a standard of living that has been the envy of the world. Remember silicone - after $4 billion and bankruptcy, the FDA re-approved silicone breast implants. Large corporations could better spend their money creating new products that could treat or cure cancer, Parkinsons, AIDS and other diseases that would truly make us the great USA. At the one meeting I attended with the DEQ and the public, I became frustrated because Dow and the DEQ were asking questions of people who mostly had no scientific background and most answers were emotional, without scientific backing. They were asking the general public what they think should be done about the problem; how their real estate values have become depressed; and what ills they think dioxin has inflicted on them. I was disappointed and upset. It's like a patient telling the doctor how to treat his illness. Many statements sounded to me like, "Give me money and I'll go away. " It's at that juncture that I said, "We'll buy your property. Sign a release from any and all liabilities and we will buy your property for two times SEV - a good price for contaminated Saginaw real estate. " A broker contacted all those who contacted me. Some even refused to pay the broker 3 percent for his paperwork and deed and closing statements. It all boils down to greed in my estimation. I have made arrangements to purchase over $1 million worth of riverfront property. I am not interested in buying high ground that does not border the river. I will continue to buy this land from anyone who feels endangered, at a negotiated price. Most people contacted want more than we offered, so how can they say property values have gone down? One editorial letter by Sandra Chisholm asked why I would be doing this. I'll try to explain: I only know what you know. I have no personal or business dealings with Dow. I have no crystal ball, but believe helping to keep jobs in Michigan is the right thing to do. By the way, I couldn't find any business friends to join me in this venture of buying property. Most scientists tell us the best way to solve this problem is to use caution when working on the soil - wash fruits and vegetables, don't eat the fish, and leave the soil alone. In time all the problems will improve, and we still can have some cookies left to do research and development, and solve other problems of the environment and economy much more serious than dioxins. I now own many parcels on the river that I neither need nor want, but when you make a commitment, I believe you should live up to it. My prime motive was to keep what business we have left in the Tri-Counties here and that is in everyone's best interest.

 Lead, air pollution, pesticides, tobacco smoke and contaminated drinking water are the most dangerous environmental threats to children, according to a study released Tuesday by the Natural Resources Defense Council. Amid a sea of chemicals - from deteriorating lead paint and auto emissions to pesticides in homes and chlorine byproducts in drinking water - children are vulnerable to mental retardation, asthma and even rare childhood cancers, the study said. The 124-page report by the nonprofit environmental group is titled "Our Children at Risk: The 5 Worst Environmental Threats to Their Health. " It identifies the exposures and recommends reforms. The study precedes the first meeting next week of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Advisory Committee on Children's Health Protection, created under an executive order last April by President Clinton. "Scientific evidence clearly demonstrates that children are uniquely vulnerable to environmental hazards," said biochemist Lawrie Mott, author of the study and a member of the committee. "Our kids are not little adults. They eat more food, breathe more air and drink more water as a percentage of their body weight compared to us and are much more vulnerable to the toxins that surround them." While scientific advances have protected the nation's young against such illnesses as polio and smallpox, thousands of synthetic substances, many of them untested, bombard growing bodies and produce other disease, Mott said. Cancer rates among children increased 10.5 percent between 1973 and 1994 with childhood cancers of the brain and other parts of the central nervous system rising 35.1 percent in the same period. Incidence of childhood asthma tripled over the last 15 years, the study said. According to the study: *About 900,000 children ages 1 to 5 have lead in their blood above the level considered safe by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lead-paint dust is the worst hazard. Common hand-to-mouth behavior increases an infant's ingestion of poisons in soil, household dust, floors and carpets and on the objects themselves. *Ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides in the atmosphere are linked to respiratory illness and symptoms, aggravation of asthma and decrease in lung function. In 1995, 18 million children under age 10 lived in areas that didn't meet federal air-quality standards. *Children are exposed to pesticides at home, schools, parks and playgrounds and in food and water. Pesticides have been associated with children suffering from leukemia, sarcomas and brain tumors, and can harm the nervous system. A nationwide survey found that 85 percent of households stored at least one pesticide, and 47 percent of households with children under the age of 5 stored at least one within the reach of children. * Tobacco smoke contains about 4,000 substances, more than 40 of which are known to cause cancer in humans and animals. Infants and young children whose parents smoke are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract ailments, including pneumonia and bronchitis. The smoke is responsible for an estimated 150,000 to 300,000 respiratory infections a year in children under 18 months, resulting in 7,500 to 15,000 hospitalizations a year. It worsens asthma in 200,000 to 1 million children a year. Forty percent of children under 11 live in homes with at least one smoker. *Children consume 2-1/4 times more water as a percentage of their body weight than adults. U.S. tap water contains microorganisms, arsenic, radon, lead, pesticides and trihalomethanes, a byproduct from chlorination. Bottled water is not necessarily better. The study said government agencies should impose deadlines to reduce dangers from lead-paint buildings, halt violations of air and drinking water standards, crack down on dangerous pesticides and eliminate tobacco advertising. Expanding "right-to-know" laws would publicize hazards to children, putting pressure on manufacturers to improve products or eliminate dangerous chemicals, the study said. The Natural Resources Defense Council wants to revise federal and state regulatory standards to incorporate children's exposure and susceptibility. The fetus is particularly sensitive to environmental toxins, the study said. The infant "gains weight more rapidly during the first four to six months after birth than at any other time (of life). The growth of integral parts of the central nervous system (brain) and the immune system (thymus) proceeds most rapidly in the first six years of life," the report said. New data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicate that the young retain greater amounts of some environmental poisons. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in the breast milk and urine of women who ate fish caught in the St. Lawrence River. The PCBs in the urine of breast-fed infants were 10 times higher than in the urine of their mothers, the study said.&lt;

 Jack Healy, the Litchfield School Building Committee chairman, has been quoted in a weekly newspaper as saying: "Parking lots don't pollute. People and cars do. If you picked up the asphalt layer of a parking lot here, you'd find particles, but you are not going to find pollution... Some of the chemicals on Mr. Williams' list aren't even found in cars. The real point here is, the kids are going to park somewhere, and if there aren't spaces, they'll park haphazardly on the roads." This statement is astonishing coming from a town official responsible for approval of a school development so crucial to the safety of students and in this case critical to the health and safety of town residents, wildlife and wetlands. Quote Medline Plus: "Driving is fatal for almost 50,000 Americans every year. People between 15 and 24 years old (especially males) have the highest rate of auto-related deaths, even though people in this age group may be smart, skilled, and have great reflexes. A collision is the most likely tragedy to kill or cripple a teenager. " Some of those serious injuries, and at least one death, occurred in Litchfield when students were driving to and from school. Taxpayers pay thousands and thousands of dollars for half full school buses. Students concerned about bus safety or boredom can be dropped off at school by parents. Now, here is a radical thought, inspired by other schools around the country, many students within reasonable range walk or bike to school. I'll bet some Litchfield students even walk to Center School. The elimination of parking for all but the students who can show a need for it, rules many school systems around the country. In this case, it is essential because beyond the student safety questions, this 120 or less car parking lot proposed to be located at the top of Plumb Hill overlooking one of Litchfield's largest wetlands, its drinking water supply and Moulthrop Brook. It is adjacent to the large sports field development that has already created some havoc with the waters below and threatens more havoc through fertilization. If you doubt that, go for a slide show at the nearby Tapping Reeve home of Betsy Glassman who took a slew of photos of muddy water 360 degrees around the project. Now for Mr. Healy's comments about the supposed minimal chemical impact of asphalt parking lots and cars and those driving around the area of Constitution Way, Route 202 and the road into White Memorial's beautiful and huge nature preserve. First, I'll deal with asphalt. From LaFarge North America' material data safety sheet on their own asphalt and it sealer: asphalt is produced from high temperature vacuum distillation of crude oil. Composition varies depending upon source of crude and specifications of final product. It can contain trace amounts of sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen compounds as well as trace amounts of heavy metals. Different asphalt grades may contain anti-stripping additive...and hydrogen sulfide.. (Toxic when heated). " The warnings say that breathing hot asphalt can cause peumonitis, pulmonary edema/hemorrhage and even death. So wouldn't it be nice for us or animals or plants to drink in particles of asphalt? In fact, the company says: "Do not allow spills, cleaning runoff to enter drains, sewers, groundwater, drainage ditches or surface waters." Besides these hazards, cars leak gas, oils, grease and anti-freeze and emit wet and dry air pollution. There are scores of Internet sites warning of the dangers of parking lot and car pollutants. You can look them up with just a few clicks of a computer mouse! Here is just one from the US Department of Agriculture: "Global spending on (water) filtration is estimated to grow from a $17 billion business in 1998 to $75 billion in 2020. And for problems such as parking lot, farm or acid mine run-off, the costs of filtering water can be prohibitive." Dennie Williams Litchfield

The leak reported on Oct. 29 now is estimated by North Dakota Department Of Environmental Quality | Taylor DeVries BISMARCK, N.D. — A crude oil spill from the Keystone pipeline in eastern North Dakota has turned out to have affected almost 10 times the amount of land as first reported, a state regulator said Monday. North Dakota environmental scientist Bill Suess said the leak reported on Oct. 29 now is estimated by state regulators to have affected about 209,100 square feet of land near Edinburg. State regulators had said the leak affected about 22,500 square feet of land. Calgary, Alberta-based TC Energy, formerly known as TransCanada, estimated its pipeline leaked an estimated 383,000 gallons of oil. Suess said that estimate has not changed. The cause of the spill still is unknown. An affected portion of the pipe has been sent to a third-party laboratory for inspection, as required by federal regulators. TC Energy said the pipeline returned to service on Nov. 10 after a repair and restart plan was approved by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The company has not given an estimate on the land that was affected, Suess said. The initial estimate by state regulators was “a quick and dirty look at it,” he said. “We did have some surface expansion since then.” The company reported late Sunday that it had recovered about 337,550 gallons of oil, along with 141,834 gallons of oily water, Suess said. Cleanup crews and state regulators remained at the site Monday. Some wetlands were affected, but not any sources of drinking water, he said. TC Energy has said people were at the site working around the clock to clean up the spill. Suess said the cleanup work was cut to daylight hours only on Monday. The company has referred questions to its website but has not updated it in more than a week. TC Energy has put up berms around the affected area and is excavating contaminated soil from the entire site, at depths of up to 6 feet, Suess said. The oily soil is being stockpiled and will be taken to a landfill in Sawyer, North Dakota, he said. “We really don’t have any risk of anything spreading at this point,” he said. Crude began flowing through the $5.2 billion pipeline in 2011. It’s designed to carry crude oil across Saskatchewan and Manitoba, and through North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri on the way to refineries in Patoka, Illinois, and Cushing, Oklahoma. It can handle about 23 million gallons daily. It is part of a system that also is to include the proposed $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline designed to transport the oil from western Canada to terminals on the Gulf Coast. The proposed Keystone XL pipeline has drawn opposition from people who fear it will cause environmental damage.

 Lisa DiJon, Timothy Doyle's ex-wife, took the stand in the morning while Ralph Zimbouski, Litchfield public works director, was questioned in the afternoon. Both had seen the bright orange hues in the landfill area. Timothy Doyle, 42, is suing the Town of Litchfield, realtors E.J. Murphy and the Webster family, including brothers Timothy and Hugh and uncle Arthur. Doyle brought the suit against the Websters and realtor for non-disclosure of polluted water and soil on the South Plains Road property he bought from the family in 1996. He is suing the town, claiming the landfill - just a short distance uphill of his property - is the source of the pollution. All three suits were combined recently by the courts as they all claim that toxins are leaching from the landfill and are contaminating the Doyle horse farm. Doyle and DiJon were married the same year they bought the farm from the Websters. Their plan was to start a horse breeding business - Donnybrook Horse Farm - and raise Irish Sport Horses. The rare breed is a cross between a thoroughbred and an Irish Draft Horse. The couple split up in 1998. The landfill had already been ordered closed and capped for environmental reasons when the couple first looked at the property. They thought the grassy hill down the street was only a recycling center, and no one told them any different, DiJon said. After they moved into the old farmhouse, neighbors informed the couple of the pollution problems plaguing Little Pitch and Camp Dutton roads. Both streets border the landfill and end downhill at South Plains Road near the Doyle farm. The couple took a walk, DiJon said and came across a small stream coming from the landfill area that was "discolored - a funky color - orangey sort of - and all the stuff around it was dead." Doyle started taking samples of water and soil on the farm. He called the town and Zimbouski came out to the farm with an independent consultant to take soil and water samples. Results showed that "it was a residence that didn't have a problem," Zimbouski said. But Zimbouski also testified that the northwest and south side slopes of the landfill show evidence of leachate, and that in September 1997 the Environmental Protection Agency "took samples of discolored soil" in those areas. Since that time, Zimbouski has seen three to four instances of leachate outbreak from the Northwest Corner - the most recent was nine months ago, he said. On the "northwest slope, the soil was an orange-rust color at the base of the slope," Zimbouski said. "When you see discoloration of the soil, it's what the EPA usually determines to be leachate."

 San Francisco health officials have found lead levels above the government's maximum standard in drinking water at one out of three of the city schools they sampled, according to a report released yesterday. The levels at one fountain at The city's The survey noted that even though the school district requires daily flushing of each fountain, record keeping has been uneven. "The San Francisco Unified School District does not have adequate staff to fully monitor the monthly reporting system that has been established," the report said. The district must provide additional training of its maintenance staff "to ensure that adequate flushing takes place" and adopt a "mandatory" fountain replacement policy, the report concluded. City health officials, however, sought to minimize the extent of the danger, noting that the risk of lead poisoning was "negligible" because of students' random use of the fountains and the comparatively low levels of exposure. "In the entire state of California, only two cases of lead poisoning have been attributed to water lead exposure," they said, and none of the 459 cases in San Francisco were from drinking lead-contaminated water. "We don't think that the water poses a significant risk," said Dr. He noted that screenings of over 15,000 children in San Francisco have shown that 7 to 8 percent had elevated lead levels but follow-up investigations determined that the source was from lead dust, paint and lead contaminants in the soil, not from water. According to experts, lead in paint chips is thousands of times more concentrated in comparison to lead in water at the acceptable Environmental Protection Agency standard of 15 parts per billion. Katz noted that San Francisco has old housing stock filled with lead paint, which was commonly used before 1978. "That's where the greatest risk is," he said, "and this is an opportunity to let parents know that they should channel their concern there." In response to the report, Superintendent of Schools The survey tested the water twice at 15 of San Francisco's 152 schools and children's centers, first in October then again in November of last year. The study was designed to check the effectiveness of the school district's current flushing program. A total of 115 fountains were sampled. The samples were taken only from children's centers and elementary schools because young children are the most seriously affected by exposure to lead, which attacks the developing nervous system and brain. The test involved "first grab samples" which determines how much lead has leached into the standing water from the pipes and solder connections leading to the fountain head. Eighteen fountains were found on the first test to have lead levels exceeding the EPA's 15 ppb standard, including a reading at one fountain at Garfield Elementary School of 78 ppb. On the second sampling, eight fountains still exceeded the standard. The Garfield fountain, for example, remained high at 57 ppb. "This would indicate that the current flushing program does not insure that the water provided at various school sites consistently meets drinking water standards on a daily basis and throughout the entire day," the report concluded. Those fountains that failed the second test were either replaced with lead-free fountains or shut off.

 DETROIT (AP) — One lawsuit seeks to replace lead-leaching water lines at no cost to customers. Another seeks money for thousands of Flint residents who unwittingly drank toxic water. A third complaint has been filed on behalf of people with Legionnaires' disease. While government officials scramble to rid Flint's tap water of lead, victims are suing Gov. Rick Snyder, the former mayor, rank-and-file public employees and almost anyone else who may have had a role in supplying the troubled city with corrosive river water for 18 months. The lawsuits accuse them of violating civil rights, wrecking property values and enriching themselves by selling a contaminated product. "How can they look at themselves in the mirror?" asked New York attorney Hunter Shkolnik, who filed the latest lawsuit Monday on behalf of 2-year-old Sophia Waid. "It's an embarrassment for government officials to take the safety of their citizens so lightly." Sophia's father, Luke Waid, said he feared losing custody of his daughter when blood tests revealed that she had elevated levels of lead. Those tests were done long before Flint's tap water was identified as the culprit in 2015. Lead affects the central nervous system, especially in children aged 6 and younger, and can cause learning problems and hyperactivity. "She's constantly on edge," Waid said of his daughter. "It's almost like she's suffering some kind of anxiety." His lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified financial award, is one of at least seven complaints involving Flint in state and federal courts. It's the first by Shkolnik and Detroit co-counsel Brian McKeen, but the lawyers plan more. Separately, 1,700 households have contacted Michael Pitt's Detroit-area firm about joining the class-action case he filed in November. The city's supply was switched from Detroit water to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014, when Flint was under state-appointed emergency management. While key facts are undisputed — the untreated river water caused lead to leach from old pipes — these cases still are no slam-dunk for lawyers specializing in personal injury. State government has defenses, especially a long-recognized cloak of immunity in certain lawsuits, said Chris Hastings, who teaches at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. "Defense lawyers aren't going to come in and say these cases don't have any merit based on the facts," Hastings said. "They're going to come in with narrow, technical defenses that exist regardless of those issues. Courts are good at setting the emotions aside and looking at the law." But, he said, victims can point to "gross negligence" as a path around governmental immunity. "That's probably the best angle," Hastings said. "But it's likely, with the wide net that's cast, that a number of defendants will still have a 'we-didn't-do-it' defense." No substantial responses have been filed. In one lawsuit, a federal judge has granted a request from the attorney general's office to give Snyder and state employees more time to explore legal defenses. Snyder spokesman Dave Murray declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate for the governor's office to discuss pending litigation. In 2013, a judge rejected a class-action lawsuit in the District of Columbia on behalf of children who may have been exposed to lead in water in Washington. The lawsuit said the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority hid elevated lead levels from customers and federal authorities between 2001 and 2004, and failed to take steps to remedy the situation. The complaint followed a study by Children's National Medical Center and Virginia Tech that determined hundreds of children were at risk of health and development problems linked to lead. Virginia Tech is also involved in studies of Flint water. Separately, attorney Geoffrey Fieger is suing a hospital and various public officials over Legionnaires' disease, not lead.

 Caption Close Robotic submarines removed a leaking cap from the gushing gulf oil well Saturday, starting a painful trade-off: Millions more gallons of crude will flow freely into the sea for at least two days until a new seal can be mounted to capture all of it. There's no guarantee that such a delicate operation almost a mile below the water's surface will work, officials said, and the permanent fix of plugging the well from the bottom remains slated for mid-August. "It's not just going to be, you put the cap on, it's done. It's not like putting a cap on a tube of toothpaste," Submersibles removed the cap that had been placed on top of the leak in early June to collect the oil and send it to surface ships for collection or burning. BP aims to have the new, tighter cap in place as early as Monday and said that, as of Saturday night, the work was going according to plan. If tests show it can withstand the pressure of the oil and is working, the gulf region could get its most significant piece of good news since the April 20 explosion on the BP-leased Deepwater Horizon rig, which killed 11 workers. "Over the next four to seven days, depending on how things go, we should get that sealing cap on. That's our plan," It would be only a temporary solution to the catastrophe that the federal government estimates has poured between 87 million and 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico as of Saturday. Hope for permanently plugging the leak lies with two relief wells, the first of which should be finished by mid-August. The government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons of oil a day are spewing from the well, and the previous cap collected about 1 million gallons of that. With the new cap and the new containment vessel, the system will be capable of capturing 2.5 million to 3.4 million gallons - essentially all the leaking oil, officials said.

 Caption Close GUILDERLAND - The legionella bacteria that sickened two residents at a Guilderland assisted living facility in February was the same strain that caused the 2012 outbreak at the Western Avenue site when it was a hotel, state testing found. The state Department of Health on Wednesday confirmed water samples from the Promenade at University Place's existing internal plumbing system matched the legionella bacteria from the sickened residents and samples from 2012, but couldn't make an exact determination where the contaminant originated. One resident died after contracting Legionnaires', but a cause of death wasn't released. The positive test was found despite owners doing an overhaul of existing plumbing and fixtures prior to opening as an assisted living facility in December. Tests done in October were negative for the bacteria. “We found a few remnants of the old plumbing system that could have helped contribute,” said Brad Hutton, deputy commissioner of the health department's office of public health. “There are also environmental conditions like changes in temperatures or (water) pressure due to construction or a nearby fire” that can dislodge bacteria. It’s unclear why there were any remnants of the old pipes, and Hutton didn’t specify where exactly these were located. Paul Fahey, a spokesperson for Promenade, said he couldn’t speak to any old piping that may have remained after renovations converting the building from a hotel into an assisted living facility. However, he noted that developers relied on consultants to make changes to plumbing and early tests showed no presence of legionella bacteria. “Things have tested negative in the past, and I think for whatever reason it reappeared now,” he said. Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria that is naturally found in water and can form in both new and old plumbing systems, especially those that aren’t regularly maintained. People are typically exposed to the legionella bacteria by breathing in the mist from a contaminated shower, hot tub or air conditioning system. Those who have cancer or compromised immune systems; smoke or have smoked; or are over 50 years old are at greater risk. It is not spread person to person. The facility was formerly the Best Western Sovereign Hotel, located at 1228 Western Ave., and was the site of a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak several years ago. That outbreak resulted in 19 people contracting the disease. In response to the recent cases, the assisted living facility owners immediately put water restrictions in place, provided bottled water and installed shower filters, and have since installed a new treatment system to specifically address legionella bacteria, Hutton said. Copper and silver ions get injected into the system, which inhibits bacteria growth, he said. Hutton said these types of systems typically aren’t installed unless a building has recurring outbreaks. “It’s a highly specialized system that would only ever be considered for a facility that has had persistent legionella,” he said. “It’s not a standard plumbing treatment system.” Fahey said initial testing with the new system has shown it’s working. The facility will continue to work with the state and its consultants to take all necessary actions, he said. “I think we’re pretty confident that the steps that we’re taking is making this a lot safer,” Fahey said. “We’re going to continue to keep an eye on this.” Going forward, the assisted living facility must conduct monthly testing to make sure the bacteria hasn’t regrown. The facility must have three consecutive months of negative testing for legionella bacteria before it can shift to less-frequent monitoring, Hutton said. Fahey said since the initial outbreak discovery, Promenade hasn’t accepted new residents and prospective residents have been provided with the same information as those currently living at the facility.

 Caption Close WASHINGTON — Fort Drum is among 90 Army installations nationwide where significant quantities of toxic PFAS chemicals have been detected in water, according to an environmental group’s report based on government data. “This is the tip of the toxic iceberg,” said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, which obtained the testing results from the Army via the Freedom of Information Act. “We just don’t know the full scope of the PFAS contamination crisis. But this new data tells us military service members likely have been drinking contaminated water for decades.” A public affairs official at Fort Drum quickly pushed back, stating that while PFAS was detected in groundwater testing wells around the post, it has not intruded into drinking water. “Our drinking water is safe,” said Julie Halpin, director of public affairs at Fort Drum, home of the 10 PFAS is a group of polyfluoroalkyl substances, a class of chemicals used in the manufacturing of non-stick plastic in cookware and other products, including clothing. Starting in the late 1960s, the military purchased PFAS-laden foam in firefighting equipment used to put out jet-fuel explosions. The 2014 discovery of a PFAS-classified chemical, PFOA — perfluorooctanoic acid — in drinking water in Hoosick Falls, led to a filtration system largely funded by Saint-Gobain, the France-based chemical company that purchased and still uses the factory blamed for the pollution. The system remains in operation to this day. PFAS chemicals have been linked to different forms of cancer, as well as reproductive and developmental health problems. Discovery of the toxic chemicals in Hoosick Falls and nearby Petersburgh caused an uproar upstate. Earlier this year, the New York state Department of Health established a threshold of 10 parts per trillion, significantly lower than the federal Environmental Protection Agency standard of 70 ppt. The Army reported test levels of 110 ppt at Fort Drum, according to the Army data obtained by EWG. Testing uncovered PFOA and two other PFAS compounds. U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-Schuylerville, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a staunch defender of Fort Drum against threats of closure, said she was aware of PFAS presence in water at Fort Drum. She said she has worked to get clean-up funding into the annual National Defense Authorization Act for 2020. Also, she said she is working on legislation to assure the Department of Defense works with state authorities “to address testing, monitoring, removal and remedial actions relating to the contamination of drinking, surface, or ground water from PFAS originating from activities of the DoD.” With the 90 sites uncovered nationwide, the total of Army posts with PFAS contaminated drinking water or groundwater went from 18 to 108, and the number of all military installations with known contamination from 207 to 297. Halpin of the Fort Drum public affairs office expressed concern that the Fort Drum area around Watertown would be needlessly worried about the quality of drinking water in the area. The fort is home to close to 15,000 soldiers and employs 3,000 civilians. Melanie Benesh, legislative attorney for EWP, disputed Fort Drum’s insistence that the area’s drinking water is safe. “The results we got from the Army were reported as 'PFAS Results of Army Owned Drinking Water Systems,’” she said. “It’s unclear if tests were taken from finished tap water or pre-treatment.” Faber of the EWG said the results from Fort Drum are striking because of what they leave out. “They don’t tell us about PFAS pollution prior to 2016, or pollution that has originated in Fort Drum and polluted the water supply around Fort Drum,” he said. “If you live in that part of New York and you’re getting water from a well, you’re on your own.”

 The company has sued the town in Superior Court at New Haven, alleging Branford’s sewage-treatment plant has contaminated the company’s 113 acres of shellfish beds on the Branford River near the outer harbor entrance. "Everyone seems to be worried about pipelines or (liquefied natural gas), which is admirable, but we have some water quality issues," said Crismale, who also is president of the Connecticut Commercial Lobstermen’s Association. The lawsuit charges the town, the Sewer Authority and the Water Pollution Control Department with negligence and nuisance. The third count is a "private attorney general" allegation, which claims the town’s actions "directly threaten the public trust" of the environment. "We want them to correct the problem or be compensated for the land," Crismale said. "The land is essentially condemned." Crismale said the parcel had a $600,000 assessed value, but that didn’t count shellfish potential. A more accurate compensation, he estimated, would be a multi-million dollar sum. "This will be handed to counsel for a vigorous defense," said Town Attorney Robin Bruce Sandler. "We don’t believe the town or any of the agencies named in the complaint are negligent." Crismale said the property is contaminated after every significant rainfall. Money then has to be spent to move the shellfish to clean waters for upward of a week before selling the shellfish. Sandler said the town was doing everything possible to maintain water quality. "The town has devoted a lot of money, time and personnel to make sure the plant is as technologically advanced as anything out there," he said. In addition to the 113 acres it owns in Branford, the company owns 117 adjacent acres in state waters to harvest clams and oysters. It leases another 3,400 acres from the state for $92,000 a year. "We cannot harvest the shellfish because it’s deemed polluted by the state of Connecticut (Department of Agriculture)," Crismale said. He called it an issue for the roughly seven years the company has owned the property, but is more problematic as the property is now being taxed as farmland. "You wouldn’t be pouring sewage over Bishop’s in Guilford or Vaiuso’s in Branford," he said. "Why should I have to tolerate sewage over our land?" Sandler said that wasn’t an ideal comparison as other farms were "above the tide." The company has also filed another lawsuit against New Haven and the Torrington-based C.H. Nickerson General Contractors for an April sewage spill into Morris Cove. Roughly 10 million gallons of sewage poured from a 24-inch sewer main over  55 hours. Crismale said his five-boat, 12-man operation was shut down for almost two weeks afterward, and he wants compensation. Ray Smedberg, executive director for the Greater New Haven Water Pollution Control Authority, couldn’t comment on legal matters, but said the major incident was mitigated with state supervision, and public safety measures are in place.

 HAZELWOOD, Mo. (AP) — The Army Corps of Engineers said it has discovered “low-level” radioactive contamination in residential yards that back up to Coldwater Creek in St. Louis County. Corps spokesman Mike Petersen said homeowners have been notified, but he couldn’t give an exact number of affected properties because some samples are still being validated. In the places where contamination was confirmed, it’s several inches beneath the soil surface and isn’t dangerous unless it’s exposed. “We’ve spoken with those homeowners and let them know what we’re dealing with and what the risk is,” Petersen said. “We have discovered it in backyards, which is not too surprising based on what we’ve found along Coldwater Creek. There’s a lot of this contamination that has spread over the years.” Since 2013, the Corps has been remediating the creek which was contaminated with uranium processing waste stored at sites near Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The Corps also is cleaning up a site north of downtown St. Louis where a former chemical company, which now makes medical products, used to process uranium for an early nuclear program. It could be months before the residential properties can be cleaned of the contamination because of other polluted sites and limited federal funds, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Residents who pushed for additional testing near the creek’s floodplain say that they aren’t surprised by the results. “We were hoping maybe they would prove us wrong,” said Jenell Wright, who lived in the area near the creek for almost 30 years. “Unfortunately our worst fears are being confirmed.” The Corps has identified radioactive contamination on private commercial property, but it’s the first time it has found contamination on residential properties. Petersen said the Corps understands that it can be alarming for residents to hear that part of their yards are radioactively contaminated, but he said “there’s nothing on the surface that we’ve found” that would pose a high risk. “We’ve taken the homeowners out and shown them where we’ve found it so they know,” he said.

A boil-water order was put into effect for the city of Jacksonville and many of its water partners. Only life-critical use of water is allowed at this time. No car washes, yard water or any other unnecessary water use is allowed until further notice. There is also a burn ban in place until further notice. During a boil water order, residential users of affected public water supplies should take the following measures to protect themselves from consuming potentially contaminated water: If the tap water is cloudy or contains particles, bottled water should be used.

 A sewage treatment failure caused by a chemical leak sent millions of gallons of untreated wastewater into the Potomac River, city and state officials said Saturday. The failure at Hagerstown's municipal sewage treatment plant occurred gradually between late Friday and noon Saturday, according to Rich McIntire, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of the Environment. By Saturday afternoon, sewage was being discharged into the river at a rate of 5.7 million gallons per day, McIntire said. The river is a source of drinking water for the Washington area, but McIntire said there was no threat to the water supply because the polluted water would be diluted by the time it reached the area. The sewage treatment system was corrupted by an unknown chemical that killed the microbes treating the water, said Rick Thomas, manager of Hagerstown's Water Pollution Control Department. "We have a biological system here, with microbes that do the work of treating sewage," he said. "The microbes can not withstand the toxins from the chemicals." Workers were trying to determine the type of chemical that got into the system and the source, Thomas said. "We've been collecting samples all day and we'll be sending them to a private lab Monday for analysis," he said. There was no immediate threat to public health, officials said. The department notified water-intake plants downstream from Hagerstown and they were taking steps to protect their water supplies, McIntire said. He said signs would be posted near the river, warning of the danger. There was little risk of people having contact with river water in February, due to cold, Thomas said. Officials said the system would flush itself out and replenish itself. "At this point there's no choice but to wait and let things run their course," Thomas said. He said crews would return Sunday morning to monitor progress and try to determine the source of the chemical leak.

 Caption Close MIDDLETOWN > > Over Easter weekend, leaking water crept into the city’s records vault, ruining an interior wall and polluting land records stored inside. Fortunately for the city’s records, Mayor Daniel Drew happened to stop by the office that Saturday and noticed the leak. “Frankly, if the mayor hadn’t walked in that Saturday, I’d have had hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage,” Town Clerk Linda Bettencourt told the Finance and Government Operations Commission Wednesday. City Hall staff moved the shelves against the rear wall of the vault, which was sustaining the bulk of the water damage, and Bettencourt’s deputies got to work transcribing some portions of the damaged records – “page by page,” said Bettencourt. “It was all hands on deck, people were pulling volumes off the shelf,” said Bettencourt. “We had 500 volumes, just laying around, and everybody trying to check them for damage.” Each of those volumes holds 1,000 pages of records. Transcribing the water damaged land records wasn’t a vast undertaking but it did require the help of all available town clerk staff. The clerk’s office has digitized records going back as far as 2004, said Bettencourt. If they had had to recreate documents from before that time, they would have had to pay Iron Mountain, an offsite records storage company, $25 per page to copy off of the city’s backup microfilm records. And while the city moved swiftly to repair the wall, the vault will still have to undergo a retrofit after a representative from the Connecticut State Library inspects it. The pipe that sprang a leak, said Bettencourt, runs through a hole in the concrete, which the state will likely find not up to code. The Common Council will consider a $50,000 appropriation Monday for new shelves, a protection system for the vault ceiling, a work station, a gate for a stairwell down to a second vault and concrete work to seal the ceiling. The repairs already completed were paid for by insurance, said Bettencourt. The downstairs vault, which holds records dating back to the 18th century, did not sustain any damage, she said.

 BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The director of the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality said Friday that the agency needs money to clean up or contain past mining waste. John Tippets told the Legislature's powerful budget-setting committee that among the problems is another collapse at the abandoned Triumph Mine in central Idaho. The state is financially responsible after agreeing to take control as part of a mining company's bankruptcy deal. Most of the cleanup projects are being paid for with federal money or endowments. But some money is coming out of the state's general fund. “It's got to be done,” said Republican Sen. Steve Bair, the committee's co-chairman, during a break in the meeting. “If we want to have a clean Idaho, we have to work at cleaning it up.” Tippets is seeking about $400,000 for the Triumph Mine site. He said the most recent collapse occurred in October, and the agency is looking at putting a third plug inside the mine to seal it and prevent contaminated water from leaking out. Tippets also sought approval to spend $500,000 at the Bunker Hill Treatment Plant in northern Idaho. The state will take over operating the plant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency next year. Money to operate the plant comes from the Bunker Hill Water Treatment Endowment Fund managed by the Idaho Endowment Fund Investment Board. That fund currently has about $71 million. The treatment plant is needed to keep lead, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium from reaching the South Fork of the Coeur d'Alene River, where it could become a health and ecological risk. Tippets also asked for approval to spend $2 million as part of on-going work to clean up the Coeur d'Alene Basin from past mining operations. That money is coming from $130 million of settlement fines to restore and remove hazardous wastes in the basin. Tippets also told lawmakers the U.S. Department of Energy is ending a $500,000 annual payment for air pollution monitoring. Tippets said that money paid for a third of the state's air quality program. Tippets said the state is losing the money because emissions at the Idaho National Laboratory have dropped below the threshold requiring such a large payment. He asked lawmakers for about $280,000 to help pay for the air quality program.

 ELK CREEK, Neb. (AP) — A company that wants to mine rare metals in southeast Nebraska plans to dump naturally occurring underground saltwater into the Missouri River, a prospect that has raised environmental concerns. Centennial, Colorado-based NioCorp Developments Ltd. has been meeting with regulators and county officials while firming plans to spend nearly $1 billion building the mine and processing facility near Elk Creek, about 70 miles southeast of Lincoln. “We’re taking a careful and measured approach here, making sure we talk to everyone before we start submitting applications,” NioCorp mining engineer Scott Honan told the Lincoln Journal Star. The company hopes to begin construction by the middle of next year. NioCorp’s primary target is niobium, which is used to harden steel and make it more heat-resistant. NioCorp has determined that it will have to continuously drain salty water from the surrounding bedrock to keep the mine from flooding. The water’s salt content is about half of seawater’s average. The company has said that once that underground saltwater is mixed into the Missouri River, the saltwater would dilute into freshwater-quality water within 5,000 feet of where it would be discharged into the river south of Nemaha. Scott Mansker, who gets his drinking water from the Missouri River and also does an annual paddle race on it, fears the mining would also add pollutants by discharging wastewater used in extracting metals from rock. “They’re looking for the cheapest way to get rid of this wastewater, and the cheapest way is to dump it in the Missouri River and never hear about it again,” Mansker said. NioCorp spokesman Jim Sims said plans call for keeping the bedrock water and processed water streams separate. Most water for processing will be recycled and all excess will be treated and discharged according to federal and state regulations, he said. Jane Kleeb, whose Bold Nebraska environmental watchdog group led the Nebraska fight against the Keystone XL oil pipeline, said Nebraska residents will be watching. “Any time a corporation wants to dump polluted water into our rivers, citizens must see in writing the plan to ensure our drinking water is not at risk and what the process is to see the test results,” Kleeb said. “The NioCorp project is known for their initial community outreach, so we hope transparency and accountability continues.”

 Waiting in their They line up along the main drag in front of empty cafes and shops and rusted mining equipment fenced off with barbed wire. Passing time, some press hands and foreheads against windows of stores that went out of business so many years ago it's hard to remember what they sold. Two graybeards stand near a telephone pole, watching for any sign of action in front of Susie's Thrift and Gift. "I hate this," the older one laments. "I hate to see Picher go." "Yeah," the other mumbles, looking down at his shoelaces. "All those memories." "Been mined out pretty bad, though." When the lead and zinc mines all around here closed down, many folks told themselves and promised their kids that Picher could go on and even be the same. There would always be church, high school football and the Dairy Queen. But that was nearly 40 years ago, and all the praying and wishful thinking can't undo what's happened here. People are leaving, escaping the reality of life in one of the worst environmental nightmares in the country. A voluntary federal buyout is hastening the exodus. This is a town's last stand. "Ol' Picher is just like the rest of us, she's 90 years old and on her last legs," says Ray reveals the stubbornness that comes with 82 years of living: He and dozens of other holdouts will not leave, even when there is no city water or Police Department. No matter how much he's offered for his property, his place will remain open until he's dead. "I don't think the lights will ever go out," Ray says, but there's something in his voice that leaves room for doubt. His birthplace is the center of the Tar Creek Superfund site, a 40-square-mile area that also takes in portions of Missouri and Kansas. For decades, before Picher became a town, miners carved miles of tunnels under its land, and the bounty of lead ore they recovered made bullets for both world wars. Neighboring communities were also undercut. During its boom, Picher's population peaked at 20,000. Saloons and movie parlors lined the streets. It was a rough-and-tumble way of life: fistfights just for the heck of it, plenty of bravado and wasted paychecks and the understanding that if you were old enough to work a shift in a mine, you were old enough to down a shot of whiskey. Picher's mines closed around 1970; the wounds they inflicted on the people and land never healed. Today, Tar Creek runs orange with acidic water that flooded the mines. Cave-ins and sinkholes threaten; a mine collapse in 1967 took nine homes. Bleak, gray mountains of lead-contaminated chat, or mine tailings, loom around town. Some rise 100 feet and look like sand dunes. They have names like Sooner, St. Joe and Golden Rod 8. For years, before most knew better, the gravel-coated piles doubled as sledding hills for kids, a Lover's Lane for teenagers and a makeshift proving grounds for dirt bikes and the high school's track team. It will take at least 15 more years to haul the stuff off, for use in highway construction projects, but that's not soon enough. The polluted dust that blows through every nook of this place has already affected a generation. In the 1990s, a study found elevated blood lead levels in Tar Creek-area children, and teachers began noticing years ago that students were learning more slowly and couldn't focus. "Don't Put Lead in Your Head," says a sign still hanging next to City Hall, showing a drawing of a smiling child. Adults suffered, too. Natives like "I would've liked to have seen the town located somewhere else, but no one wanted to see it happen," says Sparkman, who works for the town housing authority. "It should've ended in the 1960s." The federal government has stepped in with a plan to relocate residents, a buyout program that could cost $60 million. As of April, nearly 800 applications had been turned in by home and business owners, according to the More than 300 offers have been made so far and of those, 272 accepted. Only a handful of offers were rejected. The payouts won't make anyone rich - a 1,200 square-foot home fetches around $60,000 - but most residents believe this is the only ticket out of the depressed area. The town has been whittled down to 800 people. Most businesses are long gone. The truck stop on the edge of town closed when unleaded was going for $2.79 a gallon. The school system is down to 99 kids and already axed extracurricular activities like band, art and sports. But there are the holdouts, perhaps as many as 30 families, who plan to stay put. "They thought they were going to live here for the rest of their lives," says Why would people remain at a major Superfund site? Candie Crites tries to explain, even as the ground under her feet rumbles almost every day. A mine shaft lies just on the south side of her driveway, 15 feet from her shotgun house in Cardin, a spit away from Picher. When the tremors come, it sounds like a dynamite blast and shakes windows. But she can't leave the land she's lived on for decades, where the forsythias her parents planted bloom and the best memories with her late husband were made. "It hurts to see what's going on, it's literally like tearing away pages of your life or layers of your skin," Crites says, sobbing. Hoppy Ray's son, Steven, is also staying. Stubborn like his old man, the 61-year-old rattles off reasons why he thinks this place can be something again. What about the city water being turned off? "It will turn into a rural water system." Or living in a deserted city? " No more lonely than if you lived out in the country." The lead pollution, then? "I've got four If 67-year-old She hopes to get $70,000 for her house and is looking at a new place about 25 miles away. The hardest thing for her will be getting used to life without her daughter and grandkids as neighbors. Some who left as the mines were closing are still sentimental about the place.  He sympathizes with the holdouts, but doesn't pretend to know what's in store for them if they stay. "You can only go so far," says the 55-year-old, who now lives in Missouri. "It's not that much different than a gold-bust town." Sirens cut the silence. Police and fire vehicles have lined up, and it's about to begin now, the parade marking Picher's 90th - and perhaps last - birthday. Something like 300 people have turned out to pay last respects. "We cry every day," moans resident Louise Blalock, waiting in her minivan for the procession to start. "It's like a death, really." "For what it is, I'm losing my heritage," says "I feel like it's the end. That's why I'm here. This is it for me," says Norma Jean Skinner, who made the pilgrimage from California to say a proper goodbye. Cars, pickups and motorcycles roll by. Locals on the floats toss suckers and Tootsie Rolls into the street, but many of the candies aren't scooped up because there are so few kids left here. The parade ends at the After the parade, folks gather at the elementary school cafeteria for a reception. Honky-tonk music sets the mood, and couples get up from bowls of beans and cornbread for one final twirl around the floor. Paul Thomas, the town's silver-haired undertaker, sits in the back, dressed in a dark suit. The 84-year-old has buried much of this town and can remember the days when Picher's streets were crowded. "It's just fading away," Thomas says, looking straight ahead. "It just keeps getting smaller and smaller." The people shouted, line-danced and swapped stories into the afternoon about first kisses, favorite teachers and long-gone eating places like the Chili King. For a few more hours, they were the kings and queens of Picher, and no one could tell them this wouldn't last forever.

 PCB advocates, May 28, 2015 <i>Albany</i> State lawmakers are adding their voices to local officials and environmental groups calling for General Electric to expand dredging of Hudson River PCBs to include the Champlain Assemblyman On Thursday, groups including Clearwater, This month, GE Chairman and CEO Covering about 40 miles and about 500 acres of river bottom between Fort Edward and Troy, the dredging Superfund project is entering is sixth and final year. However, that agreement does not cover about 136 acres of PCB-tainted river bottom and the impaired navigation channel of the Champlain Canal. Caption Close "The navigational canal, the left-over acres of contaminated sediment and the floodplains remediation need to be addressed aggressively so river communities can continue the hard work to rebuild our economies and secure a healthier and safer future," said Mechanicville Supervisor Sixty-five municipalities along the river have passed resolutions in support of additional dredging, including the city of Albany, as well as Orange, Putnam, Rensselaer, Rockland, Saratoga, Ulster, Washington, and Westchester counties. This month, regional EPA head GE said it has cost more than $1 billion to field a flotilla of dredges and barges as well as build the treatment plant. Between 1947 and 1977, GE dumped 1.3 million pounds of PCBs into the Hudson from capacitor plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward. For more than a year, GE has been an apparent impasse over additional dredging with three federal trustees for the river — the EPA could not legally require navigational dredging under the Superfund pollution program, which leaves the issue to the state and river trustees. "Calls for significantly more dredging — beyond what EPA required — are not new," said GE spokesman The federal trustees are responsible for enforcing what is called a natural resources damages claim on the PCB damage to the river. Such claims are resolved through either a voluntary agreement or a federal lawsuit. GE has asked EPA for permission to dismantle the Fort Edward PCB treatment plant after dredging ends this year. Without the plant, it would be costly and time-consuming to resume. The current EPA cleanup plan will still leave behind unsafe levels of PCBs, said Canal officials have said it could cost $180 million to dredge PCBs from the navigation channel, which has been silting in since the 1980s because the state lacked the technology to deal with the toxins. Under the state constitution, the canal navigation channel is legally required to maintained at a minimum of 12 feet, but the current channel is much shallower and unable to handle most commercial cargo traffic. Economic development officials along the canal worry it might not be dredged for years if GE leaves without an agreement for the work. < i><a href="mailto:bnearing@timesunion.com">bnearing@timesunion.com</a></i>

 NEW YORK (AP) - State officials acting on a five-month-old threat sued Exxon Mobil on Tuesday for spilling millions of gallons of oil in a Brooklyn neighborhood and then taking decades to clean it up. The lawsuit accuses Irving, Texas-based Exxon of doing too little to mop up a huge underground oil plume lying beneath businesses and homes in Greenpoint, a section of the borough ringed by defunct refineries. Exxon accepted responsibility for much of the spill years ago and since the early 1990s has been operating a network of pumps to suck pollutants out of the ground. In February, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo declared that the cleanup was taking too long and began the process of filing a lawsuit. Negotiations since then have failed to resolve the dispute. "This situation has gone on for decades, and you still have oil under the ground. You still have oil under homes," said Cuomo, who filed the federal suit in Brooklyn on behalf of the state's environmental commissioner, Alexander Granni. Among other things, the lawsuit seeks more testing to determine the full scope of the environmental damage, a faster pace to the cleanup, a restoration of the polluted Newtowne Creek and financial penalties on the company. An Exxon spokesman, Barry Wood, called the foot-dragging allegations "unfounded." "Exxon Mobil takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously," he said. Wood noted that the company has collected more than half of the 17 million spilled gallons and is nearly doubling the number of recovery wells. The spill's exact origin is unknown, but Exxon Mobil Corp. believes it leaked over decades from its refineries and facilities operated by other companies. The damage was discovered in 1978, when the Coast Guard complained about oil draining into a waterway that separates Brooklyn from Queens.

 Caption Close NASSAU – The Environmental Protection Agency has ordered the removal of PCB-laden soil and sediments along a tributary to a trout stream as part of a second round of cleaning up polluted land near the Dewey Loeffel Landfill Superfund site, the town said Thursday. Soil testing discovered very high levels of contamination along the 1,900-foot-long creek identified as T11A that feeds the Valatie Kill, according to the town. “We reached out to EPA expressing our concerns. We’re very happy that they agreed. This is a good result. This is not only the removal of PCB-laden soil and sediments, it’s also the restoration of the habitat for the Valatie Kill,” Supervisor David Fleming said in an interview Thursday. The costs of this round of cleanup – estimated to be several million dollars -- will be paid for by General Electric and other parties responsible for the contamination at the site, the town said. Dewey Loeffel was declared a federal Superfund site in 2011. Between 1952 until 1968, an estimated 46,000 tons of toxic industrial waste was dumped at the site. EPA has already outlined that these wastes included industrial solvents, waste oil, PCBs, scrap materials, sludge and solids. PCBS – polychlorinated biphenyls – are a suspected carcinogen. The remedial work is expected to be finished in fall 2018. Town officials and residents have worked to stop the continued contamination of local waterways and supplies by runoff from Dewey Loeffel. Fleming said the steep slopes of the ravine where the tributary flows were of specific concern. He said prior cleanup work had not gone up high enough along the ravine slopes to remove contaminated materials. The tributary designated as T11A flows into the Valatie Kill which empties into Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County, south of the Dewey Loeffel site. The Valatie Kill is a protected trout stream. “I’m thankful for the continued community support to force action on a complete remediation of the Dewey Loeffel Superfund Site,” Fleming stated. “This PCB clean-up is an important step but there are many more projects that need to be completed to help heal wounds from decades of failed remediation and government incompetence in protecting the health and safety of Capital Region residents,” Fleming continued. Earlier this year, Fleming wrote the EPA, asking for action to stop the solvent 1,4-dioxane from entering the Valatie Kill. The EPA has identified the solvent as likely causing cancer in humans.

 Two San Francisco environmental groups threatened to sue the The two groups -- the San Francisco Citizens groups must serve notice on an alleged polluter before filing suit under the Clean Water Act, and the Navy now has 60 days to respond. "I expect they will comply with the law and change their practices," said The Navy would not comment on the complaint. Lieutenant Commander Lozeau said the notice was sent by certified mail on Thursday. In a press release, the two groups accused the Navy of being "one of the leading polluters of the Bay. " The groups said the Navy believes it is "immune from enforcement of laws protecting San Francisco Bay and the local community (and) has turned a blind eye to the daily discharges of toxic pollutants from its storm water system on Treasure Island." BayKeeper and ARC Ecology said the Navy has allowed excess chlorine in its treated sewage and has failed to report highly acidic discharges from its sewer plant at night. The groups said that BayKeeper, which operates from a 26-foot fishing boat, has monitored some of the discharges and that a sample of the plant's effluent collected by the Only yesterday, Lozeau said, he had taken the BayKeeper boat to the vicinity of the Treasure Island outfall on the north side of the island and observed a number of boats in the area fishing for halibut. The complaint by BayKeeper is similar to an action taken by the organization against the Navy at the former Hunters Point Naval Shipyard last year. In that case, BayKeeper eventually sued the Navy, leading to a settlement ending the alleged pollution, Lozeau said. In the Treasure Island case, the two groups are seeking a court order stopping the alleged pollution, not a fine, Lozeau said.

 Caption Close STAMFORD -- Residents living around the Heavy rainfall sent an unprecedented amount of wastewater rushing through Stamford's sewage treatment plant Wednesday night, overwhelming the facility's disinfection system and spilling 25 million gallons of partially treated sewage into the harbor. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Erika+Lelievre%22">Erika Lelievre</a> "It is disgusting. It was in all the slips and channel," said Lelievre, who has lived at the marina for eight years. "It has happened before, but this was the worst," The skies had cleared by midday Thursday, but Stamford waters remained coated in a foamy, light brown film. Mayor "We're very concerned about any exposure to water that has a very high bacteria count," Fountain said. The sewage will eventually be cleaned out of the canal through natural tidal flushing, state environmental officials said. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Stamford+Yacht+Club%22">Stamford Yacht Club</a> "It's a darn shame, and I know that that amount of rainfall causes all kinds of havoc, but to be ready to go and have something like that happen, forcing a cancellation is kind of a bummer," Ryan said. "We're hoping the next few tide cycles will clean things up for us. By tomorrow and Saturday, provided there's no more discharge, we're going to be racing." The regatta is held on the open waters of Long Island Sound and will not take place in the contaminated waters, though the location of the Yacht Club means officials will have to find safe ways for the participants to reach that open water when the races continue. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex =solr&amp;query=%22Water+Pollution+Control+Authority%22">Water Pollution Control Authority</a> Carl Bochterle, a dock master at Harbor House Marina on the East Branch, said he saw a high volume of sewage running down the channel. A large amount of sludge stuck to the docks where some people live full time on their boats. "It stinks. It is disgusting," he said. "This is not acceptable. If a boat owner had a fuel spill causing only a fraction of the problems this spill caused, they would be held responsible and fined. Why are they not made to clean this up when they decide to discharge it down the channel?" Lelievre said most people don't see what happens on the water. If something like Wednesday's sewage spill happened anywhere on land, "there would be a huge outcry," she said. "I was watching the cormorants this morning dive for food and come out of the brown muck," she said. "So they are eating, living and breathing in it out here. Something needs to be done with the sewage being released out here." The WPCA has been plagued by sewage spills in recent years, many of which were caused by equipment malfunctions at its facility. Wednesday's spill was not the result of an infrastructure failure, however, but rather by heavy, high-intensity rainfall. According to the Stamford has separate lines for its storm water and sewage. Rainwater enters underground piping through storm drains and flows directly into Long Island Sound, while sewage is flushed out of homes and businesses through a separate line, which carries the wastewater to the WPCA for treatment. During significant rainstorms, however, underground pressure from heavy rainfall can cause water to seep into the sewer lines through cracks in its joints or piping. This increases the flow of wastewater into the WPCA, straining its disinfection system. Stamford's wastewater treatment plant typically treats about 18 million gallons of sewage on an average day, and 24 million gallons on rainy days, Brink said. The facility's ultimate capacity is 58 million gallons of sewage per day, but flow levels briefly topped a record-high 73 million gallons at the height of Wednesday's rainstorm. "It's not just how many inches of rain that comes down, it's how fast it comes down," Brink said. The heavy flow made it impossible for the WPCA to completely treat all of the wastewater that flowed through its system late Wednesday night, causing the sewage spill visible in Stamford waters Thursday. Some sewage also spilled out of a manhole on Weed Avenue, city officials said. "This flow exceeded anything we've seen at the plant previously," Martin said. "We're going to do a review on why there's so much extra water in the system." The review would likely be an infiltration flow study, Brink said. WPCA officials or a private contractor would send a video camera through the city's sewer lines to identify areas where cracks are allowing water to enter the pipes. "It's very difficult to find all the sources of infiltration," he said. Brink said he did not know much the study would cost, but said it would likely be expensive since Stamford has more than 100 miles of underground sewer lines. The last big sewage spill to foul the harbor occurred in October 2012. Residents and boat owners noticed a foul stench in the water and found floating blobs of much thicker sewage all over the water, with much of it fouling boats and docks at Czescik Marina. WPCA officials sampled the sewage and said it was decomposed and appeared to be several days old. They concluded it likely ended up in the water after being illegally dumped into a nearby storm drain by a private sewage disposal company. Police reviewed surveillance videos from buildings around the harbor and the city's operations department checked storm sewers in the area for discharges, but no one was apprehended in the matter. In early 2012, The Advocate reviewed records provided by the Department of Aquaculture and found the WPCA bypassed partially treated or raw sewage into Stamford Harbor or Long Island Sound 26 times between March 2010 and October 2012. Some bypasses were small and contained as little as 10 gallons of raw sewage. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Marc+Cohen%22">Marc Cohen</a> "They go after us to use our holding tanks and can't flush out heads into the Sound. If we were caught doing that they would charge us $5,000. This does happen too often. It seems every time it rains and sometimes when it doesn't rain," Cohen said. "Sewage plants should be built to accommodate any excess they can't process until they can process it." Staff writer Maggie Gordon contributed to this report.

 Caption Close NASSAU — Town Supervisor David Fleming said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is investigating newly discovered environmental contamination that is believed to be related to the Dewey Loeffel Superfund site five miles away. The town, along with the EPA, state Department of Environmental Conservation and Department of Health, and the Rensselaer County Department of Health, have worked for the last month to reach out to residents possibly impacted by a new area of contamination on Route 203 The approximately 19-acre landfill off Mead Road is located four miles northeast of the village of Nassau in a small valley between two hills that are forested. It was formerly used as a dump in the 1950s and 1960s, much of it hazardous waste that was carried in by haulers for several companies including General Electric Co., Bendix Corporation, which is now Honeywell, and Schenectady Chemicals, which is now SI Group. The waste materials were dumped into a lagoon area, oil pit and drum burial area, according to the EPA. Fleming said the newly-found contamination off Route 203, between Sweets Crossing and Hanley roads, several miles south of the landfill, is believed to be related to Loeffel operations decades ago — perhaps as a staging area for trucks. The EPA must investigate more what the origin of the contamination is. Twenty-six private wells were tested in the area of the new contamination off Route 203 Rensselaer County provided bottled water to residents when testing began March 18, as well as providing backup water supplies at the Nassau ambulance facility. The preliminary water test results were shared with residents this week. Fleming said the EPA is continuing its investigation into the extent of contamination found, and results from the well testings still need to be finalized. The discovery of the chemical PCB, a toxic chemical now known to cause adverse health impacts in humans, points to the contamination likely coming from the Loeffel site, which holds more than  46,000 tons of industrial hazardous wastes, including solvents, waste oils and PCBs. Fleming said the EPA tested the new site after a resident at a Dewey Loeffel forum expressed concerns that the Route 203 land might be contaminated as well. The town is asking individuals who might have information about that site, or others, to email supervisor@townofnassau.org. "That is why we are asking for the public's continued assistance in locating other potential sites," Fleming said.

 NEWBURGH, N.Y. > > In this chronically struggling city along the Hudson River, residents beset by poverty, high crime and boarded-up homes now have an entirely new worry — that their tap water may have exposed them to a chemical linked to cancer. State officials recently launched an ambitious effort to offer blood tests to Newburgh’s 28,000 residents after the chemical PFOS — used for years in firefighting foam at the nearby military air base — was found in the city’s drinking water reservoir at levels exceeding federal guidelines. “The fact that I’ve been drinking that water for years, and my daughter’s been drinking and bathing in it, that’s shocking to me,” says Stuart Sachs, an artist who moved here from Brooklyn 14 years ago. “My daughter is 11. What diseases is she going to have to look forward to? It’s scary.” PFOS, or perfluorooctane sulfonate, has been linked to cancer, thyroid problems and other serious health issues. Results of the blood testing, expected to be released early next year, won’t tell people whether they’re actually at increased risk for any specific health problem, but will show how their exposure compares to others. Similar testing has been done in several smaller communities with water contaminated with PFOS or its close chemical cousin, PFOA, which is used in nonstick and stain-repellent coatings. About 1,500 people were tested near an air base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and found to have slightly elevated levels of the chemicals. In the rural villages of Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh, New York, where plastics plants are being held liable for PFOA in public and private wells, tests of about 3,000 residents that began in February have found PFOA blood levels as high as 500 times the national average. For Newburgh, about an hour’s drive north of New York City, a potential health crisis was the last thing it needed. The city, which served as George Washington’s Revolutionary War headquarters, was humming with machine shops, clothing factories, shipyards and brickyards in the early 20th century. But in the 1960s, a slow decline began after a new bridge over the Hudson River diverted traffic away from the city’s commercial center. Factories started shutting down or moving to the new highway corridor outside the city. Now the city is notorious for derelict abandoned buildings, drug gangs and violent crime. In 2014, PFOS was detected in 175-acre Lake Washington, the city’s drinking water supply, at a level 170 parts per trillion, well below the 400 ppt limit then recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When the EPA set a new level of 70 ppt for short-term exposure in May 2016, the city declared an emergency and shifted to a new water source. New York’s Department of Environmental Conservation has identified nearby Stewart Air National Guard Base as the source of the PFOS, suspecting the chemical, used for years in firefighting emergencies and drills, got into a stream leading to the city reservoir. Free blood tests are being offered through Nov. 19 to any resident who makes an appointment at one of seven clinics. But getting people tested in Newburgh presents special challenges. More than a third of residents live in poverty and more than 46 percent of households speak a language other than English at home. “Newburgh is a very poor city, and special recognition has to be given to the fact that people who are really struggling, really at the edge, are going to need extra help getting out, learning about it,” says Sachs, whose sculpture studio is in one of Newburgh’s most run-down and crime-ridden neighborhoods. “On my street, people have vaguely heard there was an issue with the water.” Newburgh resident Dorice Barnwell, who works as a medical case manager, says she knocked on doors in her own four-story apartment building and found nobody had heard about the blood-testing program, despite several public meetings and media reports. She says information should be sent home with schoolchildren and posted at street corners, on buses and in shopping centers. “We need to get this information out at all levels to everyone,” she says. “I personally sent out a mass phone text to everyone in my address book encouraging them to call the number to schedule an appointment.” Dr. Nathan Graber, director of the state health agency’s Center for Environmental Health, says his department is translating materials into Spanish and Creole and engaging with the city’s religious leaders, school superintendent and community groups to improve outreach. Even though officials have stressed blood tests won’t diagnose specific illnesses, some residents hope they will shed some light on nagging health worries. Tamie Hollins says her 18-year-old son’s sudden death in 2010 was attributed to natural causes, but now she wonders if PFOS had anything to do with it. “I’m always thinking about this, trying to find answers about what happened to my baby,” she says. “We were always very health-conscious and drank lots and lots of water, because water is life, right? Now I wonder about that.”

 NORWALK — School officials finished Monday the process of reopening rooms at Norwalk High that were closed, in some cases, for over a week after mold was found growing on the insulation of pipes that run along the ceiling of the rooms. Six classrooms, the “mini gym” and weight room on the lower level of the building were closed Oct. 19 after a teacher reported discoloration in one classroom, prompting a search of the rest of the building, said “Our staff did a visual inspection of every room in the building for other areas of discoloration,” Williams said. Officials ultimately closed down the rooms suspected of containing mold and brought in Stamford-based Hygenix Inc., an environmental consultant, to test the areas. Mold is ubiquitous in the environment and is normal to find in small amounts in a clean and healthy building, according to Hygenix. There are no governmental regulatory health standards set to distinguish an acceptable or safe level of airborne mold in buildings, rather results are often interpreted by comparing the indoor and outdoor counts and individual species of mold. <strong>Common Moisture Sources Found in Schools:</strong> Roof leaks Plumbing leaks Built-up condensation Excess humidity The rooms at Norwalk High were found to contain “moderate surface mold counts,” Williams said. The airborne mold counts were not elevated. “All molds have the potential to cause health effects,” according to the Molds have the ability to produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or asthma attacks in people who are allergic, according to the guidelines. Other molds are known to produce toxins or irritants. Therefore, “Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth,” the guidelines state. Molds can be found almost anywhere as long as moisture and oxygen are present. “When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth will often occur,” the guidelines state. “It is impossible to eliminate all mold and mold spores in the indoor environment.” Hygenix recommended the insulation on the pipes at Norwalk High be removed and replaced. That work was subsequently completed and rooms reopened on a rolling basis starting last Tuesday and running through Monday, Williams said, adding that it is protocol to close rooms down when remediation needs to take place. In an email sent out to families of Norwalk High students last week, Principal Roberts updated families with an email Monday. “Work is now completed and the areas have been cleaned and sanitized as directed,” the email read. “Hygenix subsequently completed follow up testing that has confirmed that all previously affected areas are now considered ‘clear,’ and that surface areas appear to be clean and dry.” KSchultz@thehour.com ; 203-354-1049; @kevinedschultz

 Caption Close Researchers in France said this week that they found thousands and thousands of microplastic particles raining down on a secluded spot in the Pyrenees, 75 miles from the nearest city. Their study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, suggests that microplastics — long known as a source of water pollution — may also travel by air, spreading their ill effects far from dense population centers. Deonie Allen, one of the lead researchers, said the five-month study was “the first step toward looking at microplastics as an airborne pollutant.” Steve Allen, another researcher, called their findings “scary.” “We kind of expected to find plastics there, but we certainly were not prepared for the numbers we found,” Allen said in an interview. “It was astounding: 11,400 pieces of microplastic per square meter per month, on average.” <strong>— What are microplastics?</strong> Microplastics are pieces of plastic debris that measure less than 5 millimeters long, roughly the size of a sesame seed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But they can also be much smaller than 5 millimeters. The fragments found by the Pyrenees study were generally 10 to 300 microns across, with most clocking in at roughly 50 microns, Allen said. For comparison, a human hair is about 70 microns wide. “These are invisible atmospheric pollutants,” she said. Microplastics can come from a variety of sources, including everyday items like plastic bottles or disposable contact lenses that break down into smaller pieces over time. According to Allen, a lot of microplastic pollution comes from cities, landfills and farms that are sprayed with “wastewater treatment sludge, which is loaded with microplastics.” Microbeads, which are found in some hygiene products like toothpaste, are another source of microplastic pollution. Concern over their environmental impact has led some governments, including Britain’s, to ban the manufacture of products that contain them. <strong> — Where are they found?</strong> They may be everywhere. Or, at least, wherever the water and wind can take them. In the ocean, microplastics contribute to phenomena like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a swirling gyre of more than 87,000 tons of trash that lies hundreds of miles from shore. But the Pyrenees study, a collaboration between the University of Strathclyde in Scotland and the French National Center for Scientific Research at the University of Toulouse, suggests they may also be a source of pollution in the air and on land. “At this point there is a lot of knowledge about oceans as a driver of microplastic pollution, which is creating some backlash against plastics,” Allen said. “But we are still learning that we can’t get away from it because it is also in the air.” The study took place in a remote spot 4 miles from the nearest village and roughly 75 miles from the nearest city, Toulouse. Researchers, taking samples from two separate monitoring devices, found that 365 pieces of microplastic per square meter rained down from the sky each day. Allen compared airborne microplastics to dust from the Sahara, which has long been known to travel by wind across the ocean to the United States and the Caribbean. “At 450 microns, it can still travel 3,500 kilometers,” he said. “Plastics are not as dense, they are about half the weight and they are irregularly shaped, so aerodynamically, it is easier for the particles to be lifted into the air.” <strong>— How much damage can they do?</strong> Microplastics have been found to harm animals, including insects and marine species, in a number of ways, but more research needs to be done to determine their effect on humans, researchers said. Allen said microplastics had been shown to “block up the gut” in fish and insects. “The chemicals that make up the plastic, we know they have an impact on the animal endocrine system and the lymphatic system,” which regulate the production of hormones and the elimination of bodily toxins, he said. In an example of plastic’s gut-blocking effects on a larger scale, a dead sperm whale washed ashore this month on the Italian island of Sardinia with 48 pounds of plastic in its stomach, including microplastics as well as larger items like a corrugated plastic tube and shopping bags. Allen said microplastic could also change the chemical composition of the environment in small but significant ways, for example, by absorbing pheromones that fish and insects depend on to trigger their fight-or-flight response. “When you put plastic into that environment, it absorbs that chemical, which means those protection or defense responses are no longer occurring,” she said. “It is not just about biological impacts inside the animal; it also impacts the environment it is living in.” Researchers are increasingly confident about the ubiquity of microplastics in human life. A study published in 2017 found microplastics in 83 percent of tap water samples collected from around the world, including 94 percent of samples from the United States, which had the highest rate of contamination. A study published last year found a variety of microplastics in stool samples from eight people from Finland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Britain and Austria. Another study estimated that people who frequently eat shellfish could ingest as many as 11,000 pieces of microplastic every year.

 SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Emergency workers believe they have stopped a 21,000-gallon oil leak from reaching the environmentally sensitive Great Salt Lake, one of the West's most important inland water bodies for migratory birds that use it as a place to rest, eat and breed. But the spill has taken a toll on wildlife at area creeks and ponds, coating about 300 birds with oil and possibly threatening an endangered fish. The leak began Friday night when an underground Chevron Corp. pipeline in the mountains near the University of Utah broke. The breach sent oil into a creek that flows through neighborhoods, into a popular Salt Lake City park, and ultimately into the Jordan River, which flows into the Great Salt Lake. The 10-inch pipeline was shut off Saturday morning, when workers at a nearby Veterans Administration building smelled oil and called the Salt Lake City fire department, which notified Chevron. The pipe carries crude oil from western Colorado to a refinery near the Salt Lake City International Airport. Jason Olsen, spokesman for the Salt Lake City Joint Information Center, said Sunday emergency workers believe they have contained the spill to the Jordan River. But the spill still took its toll on birds at Red Butte Creek and at a large pond at Liberty Park, where visitors often feed birds from the shore and on rented paddle boats. About 300 birds were coated in oil and cleaned at Utah's Hogle Zoo. Fewer than 10 have died, said Salt Lake City spokeswoman Lisa Harrison-Smith. Most of the birds were Canada geese, although some ducks were also covered. Harrison-Smith said the oil also flowed through several other riparian areas, which could threaten a rare Utah fish called a June sucker. It's been listed as an endangered species since 1986. Most of Liberty Park reopened Sunday. The pond remained closed, and Olsen urged those who live near affected waterways to stay away from them. "Wherever the oil is, the smell is still fairly strong," Olsen said. The Salt Lake City Police Department told residents whose yards were polluted by the spill not to clean them up, but to file a claim with Chevron first. Chevron has said it is taking full responsibility for the spill and will pay for its cleanup. Harrison-Smith said Chevron had investigators at the scene of the leak Sunday and that the Environmental Protection Agency had brought in a U.S. Coast Guard water recovery expert to assist with cleanup efforts. She said city officials were hoping to receive a report on the spill from Chevron sometime Sunday evening. U.S. Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, said he spoke by telephone Sunday with Becky Roberts, president of the company's Chevron Pipe Line Co. unit. Matheson said Roberts told him that until Chevron crews dig up the broken section of pipe, the company can't be sure what caused the leak. Matheson is urging full disclosure on the leak's cause, and said his office will follow up to make sure Chevron follows EPA regulations. "I would say they are responding very aggressively to it. I think they know there is a heightened concern among people in this country about oil spills," Matheson said. "I think they understand it's in their best interest to do everything they can to fix this as soon as possible."

 FLINT (AP) — Officials say lead has been found in water at a building on the campus of the Michigan School for the Deaf in Flint. A letter from school officials Wednesday says Stevens Hall dormitory is affected. No lead was detected in water at the school building. The school says it's been purchasing bottled water since September and had no positive tests for lead prior to the latest result. The Flint Journal reports the school didn't release details about the amount of lead found in the water. Flint's water became contaminated with lead when the city began drawing from the Flint River in 2014 as a cost-cutting measure while under state financial management. The water was not properly treated to keep lead from pipes and plumbing from leaching into the supply.

 Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency officials were examining oil samples to pinpoint the source of the spill that contaminated 17 miles of American and Canadian shoreline. No single source of the spill had been identified. Officials said the substance appeared to be used, industrial-grade oil. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service investigators were studying the oil’s impact on plants and animals in the area. Wildlife specialists will help collect struggling waterfowl and other animals over the next few days. The oil was not believed to be near municipal water intakes, the Coast Guard has said. Civil and criminal punishments for polluting the environment will be pursued if the source of the pollution is found. Federal law caps civil penalties at $27,500 per violation, per day. Also, responsible parties have to pay the entire cost of the clean-up, which could cost more than $100,000. Recreational boaters were being asked to avoid the Detroit River south of the Rouge River. Commercial vessels were asked to travel slowly to disturb the oil as little as possible. The Coast Guard also advised people to avoid walking on the Detroit River shoreline in Michigan or Ontario from the Rouge River mouth to Lake Erie, said Petty Officer Adam Wine. Investigators have traced oil to a storm drain on the Rouge River but do not know its source or composition, Wine said. About 1 1/2 miles of the Rouge River, which flows eastward into the Detroit River at Detroit’s southern border, was closed to all ship traffic Wednesday afternoon. The spill in the Rouge River was reported Tuesday. The spill in the Detroit River was reported Wednesday. Marine Pollution Control, a private company based in Detroit, was using floating barriers to prevent the oil from reaching Humbug Marsh and other environmentally sensitive areas.

 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) — Michigan officials said Wednesday that Enbridge Energy Partners had violated a legal requirement by having too much unsupported space along its twin oil pipelines running beneath the environmentally sensitive waterway that links Lakes Michigan and Huron. Enbridge found similar problems two years ago with the pipelines in the Straits of Mackinac and said it had taken steps to ensure they would not happen again, but recent findings "have refuted that prediction," state Attorney General Bill Schuette and other officials said in a letter to the Canadian company. The pipes are a small section of Enbridge's 645-mile-long Line 5, through which 23 million gallons of crude oil and liquid natural gas move daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. Environmental groups have pushed to shut down the underwater pipes, saying a rupture could do catastrophic damage to the Great Lakes. The company insists the pipes have never leaked and are closely monitored. "The violation notice issued today by state leaders should serve as a wake-up call," said Lisa Wozniak, executive director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters. "Due to the risk the Line 5 pipeline poses to our Great Lakes, we must stop oil from flowing along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac as quickly as is feasible." Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said the pipes were stable and the need for more supports did not signal a safety threat. "Our inspection process did what it's designed to do," he said. Some sections of the underwater pipes rest directly on the lake bottom, while others are supported by steel anchors held in place by screws drilled into the lakebed. An easement granted by the state when the lines were laid in 1953 requires that no section of the pipelines longer than 75 feet be without support from either the ground or an anchor. But during a June inspection with a remote underwater vehicle, Enbridge discovered four locations where unsupported sections exceeded the limit by a foot or two, Duffy said. "Enbridge is legally responsible not only for promptly correcting this violation of the easement, but taking effective measures for preventing any more recurrences of this problem," said the letter signed by Schuette; Department of Environmental Quality Director C. Heidi Grether; and Keith Creagh, director of the Department of Natural Resources. The spacing problems were caused by sediment erosion that created open areas beneath the pipes, Duffy said. Enbridge has applied for a DEQ permit to install anchors in the four spots that were detected and 15 others that could exceed the 75-foot limit as future erosion occurs, he said. "The Great Lakes is a dynamic environment and we anticipated that at times there can be changes to the lake bottom," Duffy said. But the state officials said the company had found other spacing issues during its last underwater inspection in 2014. At that time, Enbridge installed 40 more anchors and said it had developed a "predictive maintenance model" that would ensure the 75-foot limit would not be exceeded again. The officials instructed Enbridge to explain why its model had failed and come up with a better plan within two weeks. One possible improvement would be more frequent inspections and support installations, they said. Enbridge agreed to stepped-up inspections of the Straits of Mackinac pipelines last month under a $176 million settlement with the federal government from a 2010 rupture of another pipeline that polluted the Kalamazoo River in southwestern Michigan, the costliest inland oil spill in U.S. history.

 State and local officials have stepped in to stop Sanitary Services from alleged illegal dumping and storing of waste at its Manchester headquarters. Authorities on Friday discovered six dozen containers of bulky waste at the site. Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and state Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque Jr. have obtained a court order against the company. Officials found the waste Friday after learning that effective July 20, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority had barred Sanitary Services from dumping commercial-contract bulky waste at the CRRA's trash-to-energy plants for failure to pay tipping fees. "This company is a poster boy for chronic polluters -- powerful evidence that we need a licensing system for trash haulers that stops repeat lawbreakers from doing business," said Blumenthal. He is already suing Sanitary's sister firm, Recycled Fibers, over improper waste storage.

 TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) -- A ruptured section of pipeline that spewed hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into a southern Michigan river will be ready for inspection and removal shortly, officials said Thursday. The damaged segment has been hard to reach since the spill was reported July 26 because it's in a marshy, oil-covered area of Calhoun County. It will be examined in the ground at first and eventually cut out and shipped to a National Transportation Safety Board lab for tests, regulators said. Officials with Enbridge Inc. and government agencies said the cleanup of the Kalamazoo River and other polluted waterways was going well, as crews continue removing tainted water and placing boom material as needed to contain and absorb the oil. Contaminated soil and leaked crude have been removed from 2 acres of the 5-acre zone closest to the spill site, said Mark Durno, the Environmental Protection Agency's deputy incident commander. Over 2.5 million gallons of oily water have been sucked out, he said. "We're moving from crisis to cleanup slowly, day by day," Durno said. Residents of the Battle Creek area have reported seeing increased amounts of oily sheen recently, but that's because rainfall has washed oil from the riverbanks and wetlands, said Susan Hedman, the EPA's regional chief. "That is a way of capturing the oil and cleaning the shoreline in a very efficient manner," Hedman said. She said the EPA had approved the portion of Enbridge's cleanup plan dealing with health and safety. The 30-inch pipeline, laid in 1969, carries about 8 million gallons of oil daily from Griffith, Ind., to Sarnia, Ontario. Up to 100 feet of pipeline could be removed for the leak investigation, said Steve Wuori, an Enbridge executive vice president. Enbridge reported the leak to federal officials July 26, although U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer, a Battle Creek Democrat, contends it began the previous night when the Canadian company shut down the pipeline for maintenance. Schauer has accused Enbridge, based in Calgary, Alberta, of violating federal regulations by taking too long to report the spill, which the company denies. The EPA has said more than 1 million gallons of oil leaked, while the company estimates the total at 820,000 gallons. A state official said Thursday that hundreds of fish and some mussels were killed when water levels were lowered in a downstream reservoir called Lake Allegan to help contain the oil spill. Carp, largemouth bass and bluegills were among fish stranded by the 2-foot drop in levels, said Jim Dexter of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment. Seven types of freshwater mussels, two of which are on the state list of endangered and threatened species, were found on the newly exposed shoreline. But many will live long enough for the levels to return to normal, Dexter said. A Battle Creek couple filed a federal lawsuit against Enbridge last week and requested status as a class-action case that other area residents could join. The Great Lakes Environmental Law Center has threatened a suit alleging Clean Water Act violations. "Lawsuits are launched in order to recover damages," said Patrick Daniel, Enbridge's chief executive. "We're indicating there is no need for lawsuits because we will pay for all damages related to the spill."

 Caption Close COVINGTON, La. (AP) -- BP on Wednesday launched its latest bid to plug the gushing well in the Gulf of Mexico by force-feeding it heavy drilling mud, a maneuver known as a "top kill" that has never before been tried 5,000 feet underwater. The oil giant's chief executive earlier gave the procedure a 60 to 70 percent chance of working, and President Barack Obama cautioned Wednesday there were "no guarantees." BP spokesman Steve Rinehart said the company will pump mud for hours, and officials have indicated it may be a couple of days before they know whether the procedure is working. The top kill involves pumping enough mud into the gusher to overcome the flow of oil, and engineers plan to follow it up with cement to try to permanently seal the well. A live video stream showed pictures of the oil gushing and the blowout preventer, the five-story device the mud was being pumped into. A weak spot in the device could blow under the pressure, causing a brand new leak. Gene Beck, a petroleum engineering professor at Texas A&M in College Station, said the endeavor would likely fail quickly if the mud could not overcome the pressure of the oil. "The longer it goes, maybe the better news that is," Beck said. "They are hoping that nothing breaks, that they don't have any failures in what they're pumping into." BP PLC was leasing the rig Deepwater Horizon when it exploded April 20, killing 11 workers and triggering the spill that has so far spewed at least 7 million gallons into the Gulf. Oil has begun coating birds and washing into Louisiana's delicate wetlands. Witness statements obtained by The Associated Press show senior managers complained BP was "taking shortcuts" the day of the explosion by replacing heavy drilling fluid with saltwater in the well that blew out. Truitt Crawford, a roustabout for drilling rig owner Transocean Ltd., told Coast Guard investigators about the complaints. The seawater, which would have provided less weight to contain surging pressure from the ocean depths, was being used to prepare for dropping a final blob of cement into the well. "I overheard upper management talking saying that BP was taking shortcuts by displacing the well with saltwater instead of mud without sealing the well with cement plugs, this is why it blew out," Crawford said in his statement. BP declined to comment. The statements show workers talked just minutes before the blowout about pressure problems in the well. At first, nobody seemed too worried: The chief mate for Transocean left two crew members to deal with the issue on their own. What began as a routine pressure problem, however, suddenly turned to panic. The workers called bosses to report a situation, with assistant driller Stephen Curtis telling one senior operator that the well was "coming in. " Someone told well site leader Donald Vidrine that they were "getting mud back." The drilling supervisor, Jason Anderson, tried to shut down the well. It didn't work. Both Curtis and Anderson died in the explosion. At a hearing in New Orleans on Wednesday, Douglas Brown, the Deepwater Horizon's chief mechanic, testified about what he described as a "skirmish" between someone he called the "company man" -- a BP official -- and three other employees during a meeting the day of the explosion. Brown said he didn't pay particular attention to what they were discussing because it did not involve his engine room duties. He later said he did not know the BP official's name. "The driller outlined what would be taking place, but the company man stood up and said 'We'll be having some changes to that,'" Brown testified. He said the three other workers initially disagreed but "the company man said ' This is how it's going to be.'" Frustration with BP and the federal government has only grown since then as efforts to stop the leak have failed. Obama prepared to head to the Gulf on Friday to review efforts to halt the oil that scientists said seems to be growing significantly darker, from what they can see in an underwater video. It suggests that heavier, more-polluting oil is spewing out. Bob Bea, an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said the procedure carries a high risk of failure because of the velocity at which the oil may be spewing. "I certainly pray that it works, because if it doesn't there's this long waiting time" before BP can dig relief wells that would cut off the flow, Bea said.

 An oil spill is washing up onto one of Europe's best surfing spots, the Basque coast of southwest France, where cleanup workers in protective suits have replaced the usual crowds of surfers in wet suits. Until this week, only small patches of oil from the sunken tanker Prestige had washed ashore on the beaches of France's Basque and Landes regions _ a stretch of about 90 miles. Most of the damage was in Spain. But in recent days, the tide has brought in thick sheets of oil. The areas hardest hit were the beaches around the resort town of Biarritz and nearby Anglet, close to the border with Spain and known for towering waves that draw surfers from around the world. With most beaches closed, some surfers spent their days just hanging around. "We're disgusted by this," said Mike Cameron, a French-American surfer who said he splits his year between California and the Basque coast. "We come here to prepare for spring and summer competitions, but this year we're wondering what we're going to do." White-suited cleanup crews worked with shovels to crack apart the large globs of oil and remove them from the beaches. A slick believed to measure 125 miles in length was spotted in the Atlantic some 30 miles from the coast and could reach shore within the week, LCI television reported. Traces of oil from the sunken Prestige first hit the French coastline in late December. Along with surfing, another casualty was oyster farming. France temporarily halted sales of oysters in January from the Bay of Arcachon, south of Bordeaux, which harvests 12,000 tons of oysters a year. The aging, single-hulled Prestige, which was carrying 20.5 million gallons of fuel oil, split in two and sank off the Spanish coast on Nov. 19. Its thick, gummy oil has already polluted hundreds of miles of coastline in Spain.

 Associated Press Writer MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A damaged tanker carrying more than 20 million gallons of fuel oil broke in two off northwest Spain and sank Tuesday, threatening an environmental disaster. The Bahamas-flagged Prestige vanished into the ocean at midday, said Lars Walder, a spokesman for the Dutch salvage company SMIT. The ship's oil containers seemed to remain intact, but the toxic fuel was likely to seep out eventually. An environmentalist warned the wreckage would be like a "time bomb" about two miles down on the ocean floor. Nearly 1.3 million to 2.6 million gallons of fuel oil lost in the initial spill last week have already tainted miles of Spanish beaches, threatening rich fishing grounds and devastating wildlife. If the ship lost its entire cargo of fuel oil, the spill would be nearly twice the size of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska. Some 10.92 million gallons of crude oil were lost from the Valdez. The tanker ruptured last Wednesday during a storm, and was towed some 150 miles out to sea. The crew was airlifted to safety last week. The incident caused friction between Portugal and Spain, which disagreed over who was responsible for the cleanup. Prevailing winds put Spain's coast at a greater risk for damage from the spill. It also irritated relations between Britain and Spain amid charges that port inspectors should have spotted obvious problems with the ship, which had stopped repeatedly in the British colony of Gibraltar. The two countries have long been at odds over ownership of the rocky promontory on Spain's southern coast. Spanish beaches were mired in oil and scores of animals were covered in sludge. Fishing was prohibited, putting hundreds out of work. The spill threatened some of the region's richest fishing grounds. Fuel oil, a heavy, viscous blend gathered from the bottom of tanks at the end of the refining process, can be far more toxic and difficult to clean up than crude oil, experts said. "We hope that the sunken part does not spill its fuel. But still it's a time bomb at the bottom of the sea," said Maria Jose Caballero, who leads the coastal protection project for Greenpeace in Spain. The best hope for the environment is for the tanks to hold in the chilly waters, said Unni Einemo, senior editor at Bunkerworld, a London-based news service for the marine fuels industry. "If it sinks into cold water, this stuff solidifies so much that it basically stays there," she said. The Prestige, which flies under a Bahamian flag, is owned by Mare Shipping Inc., which is registered in Liberia, and managed by a Greek company, Universe Maritime, Ltd. It was traveling from a Baltic port to Singapore, carrying a load of Russian oil, when the storm hit, Universe Maritime said. The American Bureau of Shipping, a Houston-based registration company that makes sure shipping papers are in order, said the Prestige was up to date with its inspections. The vessel, built in 1976, had its last annual survey in Dubai in May, and a full drydock inspection in China in May 2001, ABS said. A Universe Maritime spokesman complained that the damaged vessel had been exposed to storms because it had been forced so far off shore. The Spanish government had ordered the ship far from land to limit contamination. The tanker sustained a 30- to 50-foot crack in its hull below the waterline which made it unable to proceed under its own power while salvagers sought a port to do repairs or transfer the oil to another ship. The Oil Spill Response Center in Southampton, England, a nonprofit organization owned by the international oil industry, sent a team to help Spanish officials deal with the spill. Detergents are ineffective for cleaning up fuel oil, he said. "It is the most difficult of the fuels to clean up," said the group's chief executive, Archie Smith, adding that the toxicity of fuel oil is diminished somewhat after it comes into contact with sea water. Spanish soldiers and volunteers were using buckets and shovels to remove oil some 40 miles of coastline between Cape Finisterre and the city of A Coruna, about 370 miles northwest of Madrid. Elsewhere, emergency workers tried to vacuum oil from beaches. Sea birds floated helplessly in the blackened waves and fish washed ashore. Volunteers tried to rescue about 150 of the injured animals. "We've seen many dead fish and birds and many others in agony when we rescue them," said Ezequiel Navio, from the World Wildlife Fund's Spanish branch. Spain's Interior Ministry said the ship went down in an area where Portugal had responsibility for maritime rescues. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Durao Barroso said it was "absolutely sure and confirmed" by the Portuguese Navy that the tanker was lying in Spanish waters. Both Portugal and Spain had barred the salvagers from towing the ship to any of their ports to protect their fishing and tourism industries. The tanker's Greek captain, Apostolus Maguras, was jailed on charges of disobeying authorities and harming the environment. In Brussels, EU officials demanded governments move faster to enforce new inspection rules that could prevent such catastrophes. Under the rules, ports are required to check at least 25 percent of all ships coming in, starting with older, single-hull vessels. Ships flying "flags of convenience" _ or registered in countries with lax safety, labor or tax rules _ are to be given priority, said Gilles Gantelet, spokesman for the European Commission. The regulations are meant to catch ships like the Prestige, which stopped in Gibraltar last June. Authorities there say it did not enter the port, but only stopped for restocking. It also put in on June 7 at the Greek port of Kalamata, but Greek officials said because it was "in transit," it was not subject to inspections under treaty obligations. EU officials attacked such distinctions as potentially dangerous. The EU measures were adopted after the tanker Erika broke apart and sank in 1999, discharging 3 million gallons of fuel oil and polluting 250 miles of French coastline. Spain's northwest coast has suffered several tanker accidents in recent years. The worst was in 1992, when the Greek tanker Aegean Sea lost 21.5 million gallons of crude oil when it ran aground near A Coruna.

The best hope for the environment is for the tanks to hold in the chilly waters, said Unni Einemo, senior editor at Bunkerworld, a London-based news service for the marine fuels industry. "If it sinks into cold water, this stuff solidifies so much that it basically stays there," she said. The Prestige, owned by Mare Shipping Inc., of the Bahamas, was bound for Singapore when the storm hit. The American Bureau of Shipping, a Houston-based registration company that makes sure shipping papers are in order, said the Prestige was up to date with its inspections. The vessel, built in 1976, is operated by the Greece-based Universe Maritime, Ltd. The ship's last annual survey was carried out in Dubai in May, and a full drydock inspection was carried out in China in May 2001, ABS said. A Universe Maritime spokesman complained that the damaged vessel had been exposed to storms because it had been forced so far off shore. The Spanish government had ordered the ship far from land to limit contamination. The tanker sustained a 30- to 50-foot crack in its hull below the waterline which made it unable to proceed under its own power while salvagers sought a port to do repairs or transfer the oil to another ship. The Oil Spill Response Center in Southampton, England, a nonprofit organization owned by the international oil industry, sent a team to help Spanish officials deal with the spill. Detergents are ineffective for cleaning up fuel oil, he said. "It is the most difficult of the fuels to clean up," said the group's chief executive, Archie Smith, adding that the toxicity of fuel oil is diminished somewhat after it comes into contact with sea water. Spanish soldiers and volunteers were using buckets and shovels to remove oil some 40 miles of coastline between Cape Finisterre and the city of A Coruna, about 370 miles northwest of Madrid. Elsewhere, emergency workers tried to vacuum oil from beaches. Sea birds floated helplessly in the blackened waves and fish washed ashore. Volunteers tried to rescue about 150 of the injured animals. "We've seen many dead fish and birds and many others in agony when we rescue them," said Ezequiel Navio, from the World Wildlife Fund's Spanish branch. Spain's Interior Ministry said the ship went down in an area where Portugal had responsibility for maritime rescues. Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Durao Barroso said it was "absolutely sure and confirmed" by the Portuguese Navy that the tanker was lying in Spanish waters. Both Portugal and Spain had barred the salvagers from towing the ship to any of their ports to protect their fishing and tourism industries. The tanker's Greek captain, Apostolus Maguras, was jailed on charges of disobeying authorities and harming the environment. In Brussels, EU officials demanded governments move faster to enforce new inspection rules that could prevent such catastrophes. Under the rules, ports are required to check at least 25 percent of all ships coming in, starting with older, single-hull vessels. Ships flying "flags of convenience" _ or registered in countries with lax safety, labor or tax rules _ are to be given priority, said Gilles Gantelet, spokesman for the European Commission. The regulations are meant to catch ships like the Prestige, which stopped in Gibraltar last June. Authorities there say it did not enter the port, but only stopped for restocking. It also put in on June 7 at the Greek port of Kalamata, but Greek officials said because it was "in transit," it was not subject to inspections under treaty obligations. EU officials attacked such distinctions as potentially dangerous. The EU measures were adopted after the tanker Erika broke apart and sank in 1999, discharging 3 million gallons of fuel oil and polluting 250 miles of French coastline. Spain's northwest coast has suffered several tanker accidents in recent years. The worst was in 1992, when the Greek tanker Aegean Sea lost 21.5 million gallons of crude oil when it ran aground near A Coruna.

 Associated Press Writer MADRID, Spain (AP) _ An oil tanker carrying 20 million gallons of fuel oil broke in two and sank Tuesday in the Atlantic Ocean, threatening a spill nearly twice as big as the Exxon Valdez's and an environmental catastrophe along a scenic Spanish coastline. The hope was that the oil would sink and harden in waters more than two miles deep before it could inflict disaster and engulf the area's rich fishing grounds. But it has already soiled 125 miles of Spanish coastline, and its highly viscous and toxic load is far bigger than the 10.92 million gallons dumped off Alaska by the Exxon Valdez in 1989. As the Bahamas-flagged tanker Prestige sank, it leaked between 800,000 to 1.02 million gallons of oil, according to government estimates. SMIT, the Dutch salvage company hired to keep the ship afloat, estimated the spillage at 13 percent of its load. Nor was it clear much oil might reach land, or where. Portugal said it was monitoring a slick 22 miles by one-third of a mile. Shut out of Spanish and Portuguese ports after its hull split in a storm six days ago, the tanker was towed some 150 miles out to sea off the coast of Spain's Galicia region. When it finally capsized and sank crews were already cleaning up Galicia's coast, where an estimated 800,000 gallons of oil has contaminated fisheries, blackened beaches and killed wildlife. The calamity has highlighted concerns about older, single-hull ships like the 26-year-old Prestige that are due to be phased out by 2015 _ and about what Europe should do to keep them safe and inspected in the meantime. The European Union charged Tuesday that single-hull ships skirt European ports to avoid tough new EU-mandated inspection rules. It urged national governments to work harder to enforce them. Spain said the ship had not been inspected since 1999, but the ship's Greece-based management company, Universe Maritime Ltd., claimed the vessel underwent an inspection last May. At stake in Spain's misty, green, northwest corner is a fishing and seafood industry that feeds much of the country and does more than $330 million in annual business. It employs tens of thousands of people who catch, process or sell everything from monkfish to mussels. Fuel oil, used to power ship engines and electricity plants, is harder to clean up than the crude spilled by the Exxon Valdez. Crude disperses in sea water but fuel oil turns to sticky lumps. "It's a big, sticky, gooey mess _ a bit like molten asphalt," said Unni Einemo, senior editor at Bunkerworld, a London-based news service for the marine fuels industry. On Tuesday, soldiers and volunteers were still cleaning up the beaches between Cape Finisterre north to the city of A Coruna, about 370 miles northwest of Madrid. Dozens of inlets and coves were coated in thick oil, while up to 150 animals, mostly seabirds, were taken away for treatment. "We've seen many dead fish and birds and many others in agony when we rescue them," said Ezequiel Navio, of the World Wildlife Fund's Spanish branch ADENA. The Spanish government declined to estimate economic or ecological damage. The hope is that most of the fuel oil went down with the ship. "If it sinks into cold water, this stuff solidifies so much that it basically stays there," said Einemo. Greenpeace said it wasn't so sure. "We hope that the sunken part does not spill its fuel. But still it's a time bomb at the bottom of the sea," said Maria Jose Caballero who heads the environmental group's coastal protection project. "There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil," she added. "It's insoluble, viscous and sticky, which makes it difficult for the clean-up operations." Northwest Spain suffered a disastrous spill 10 years ago when the Greek tanker Aegean Sea ran aground and lost 21.5 million gallons near A Coruna, along a shipwreck-prone shore known as the "coast of death." The ship is owned by Liberian-registered Mare Shipping Inc. But it will be represented in damage claims by Universe Maritime, said a spokesman for the latter, Stephen Askins. Mare Shipping's only office is in Monrovia but through the ship's managers the firm is eager to work with Spanish authorities, insurance companies and international maritime insurance funds, Askins said. "There is no suggestion that the owner, as a small Liberian company, would be expecting people to try to find it in Liberia and register their claims," Askins said. "I don't need to tell you how big this is as an incident." The new EU inspection measures were adopted after the 1999 Erika oil spill polluted 250 miles of French coastline. They require port authorities to check at least 25 percent of all ships coming into dock, starting with older, single-hull vessels. Priority goes to ships flying "flags of convenience" _ or registered in countries with lax safety, labor or tax rules.

 Associated Press Writer Hurricane Ivan punched holes in the network of oil and natural gas pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico, causing fuel leaks at several points along the thousands of miles of channels. As of Wednesday, nearly two weeks after Ivan hit the Gulf Coast, the Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard were still unsure how many oil spills were caused by cracked pipelines. Most of the pipelines in the hurricane path were shut in and being inspected. At a Shell Oil Co. pipeline about 30 miles east of Venice, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, crews had gathered about 101,000 gallons of water polluted with oil. In the wake of the hurricane, oil production in the Gulf is more than 3 million barrels per week below average, putting U.S. crude inventories at historically tight levels and contributing to the record price of oil. "We all know there was certainly a lot of damage caused by Ivan to the pipeline system," said Caryl Fagot, a spokeswoman for the Minerals Management Service. "I do not have a good count as to how many leaks there have been." She added there were no reports of major pollution in federal waters, which extend 200 miles out from the mainland. The extent of what happened during Ivan may never be known, Fagot said. Although many pipelines were closed and emptied, companies have much leeway in what they do with their pipelines, she said. "If there were oil spills during the storm, and they were dissipated, we will never know," she said. Roland Guidry, the oil spill coordinator for Louisiana, said companies sometimes take a chance and leave oil and gas in their pipelines when a storm approaches. Ivan also damaged and knocked over several oil rigs _ that dot parts of the Gulf south of Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana _ but there were no reports of oil leaks from them. When a hurricane comes, oil wells are secured. Environmentalists said Ivan, and the threat of busier hurricane seasons to become more common, demonstrated that oil and gas exploration in the Gulf is dirty and dangerous to the marine ecosystem. "If this becomes the norm, more and more hurricanes, are they prepared? Have these rigs been hardened? Was it designed with a different reality in mind?" said Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace USA. The Minerals Management Service has asked companies to inspect oil rigs and pipelines in the path of Ivan for damage. That work, much of it done underwater, may take months to finish. No public announcement was made about the oil spill near Venice. Officials said there is no requirement to notify the public about an oil spill. In waters near Louisiana's coast, all near Venice, four oil spills were being worked, Guidry said. He said there was no estimate how much oil leaked out. "That oil is floating around all over there and everyone is picking it up," he said. He called the leak at the Shell pipeline a medium spill. He said it was broken in two by wave action that made the pipeline look "like skip rope." He said there were reports of "some oiled pelicans." He added: " But they're not that heavily oiled."

 Associated Press Writer Rough seas forced pipeline and oil rig repair crews out of the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday, delaying efforts to get the nation's oil and natural gas infrastructure on track after Hurricane Ivan. Ivan's damage and the rise in oil prices to more than $52 a barrel highlighted the nation's dependency on oil and gas activities in the Gulf. The storm ripped rigs off their bases and cracked sections in the extensive pipeline system that feeds the country much of its fuel. Broken pipelines caused at least four oil spills off the Louisiana coast and others farther out in the Gulf. "The weather in the next couple of days will have an impact on the repair work," said Fred Palmer, a Shell Oil Co. spokesman. As of Wednesday, nearly three weeks after Ivan hit the Gulf Coast, the federal Minerals Management Service and the U.S. Coast Guard were still unsure how many oil spills were caused by cracked pipelines. Most of the pipelines in the hurricane's path were shut in and being inspected. At a Shell pipeline about 30 miles east of Venice, near the mouth of the Mississippi River, crews had gathered about 101,000 gallons of water polluted with oil. On Thursday, the Coast Guard said there were no sightings of oil in the water. "There seems to be no visible oil. So, therefore, cleanup operations have been completed," said Kyle Niemi, a Coast Guard spokesman said. In the wake of the hurricane, oil production in the Gulf is more than 3 million barrels per week below average, putting U.S. crude inventories at historically tight levels and contributing to the record price of oil.

 BATTLE CREEK, Mich.  -- Crews were working Tuesday to contain and clean up more than 800,000 gallons of oil that poured into a creek and flowed into the Kalamazoo River in southern Michigan, coating birds and fish. Authorities in Battle Creek and Emmett Township warned residents about the strong odor from the oil, which leaked Monday from a 30-inch pipeline built in 1969 that carries about 8 million gallons of oil per day from Griffith, Ind., to Sarnia, Ontario. Crews waded in oily water as they worked to stop the oil's advance downstream. Oil-covered Canada geese walked along the banks of the Kalamazoo River, and photos showed dead fish floating in the spill. The Kalamazoo River eventually flows into Lake Michigan, but officials didn't expect the oil to reach the lake. "This is just a disaster," said Raymond Woodman, 33, of Emmett Township, who watched workers use a vacuum truck to suck oil from the water at the Ceresco Dam, downstream from leak. "It shouldn't matter how much it costs to clean this up. They need to clean it up." Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge Inc.'s affiliate Enbridge Energy Partners LP of Houston estimated about 819,000 gallons of oil spilled into Talmadge Creek before the company stopped the flow. Enbridge crews and contractors deployed oil skimmers and absorbent booms to minimize its environmental impact. "We are going to do what it takes to make this right," Enbridge's president and CEO Patrick D. Daniel said during a news conference in Battle Creek. The company had begun testing the air near the spill, with the primary concern being the possible presence of the cancer-causing chemical benzene. On Tuesday, the company said it hadn't found any levels that would be of concern in residential areas. Groundwater testing also was planned. Authorities evacuated two homes near the leak, and some locals said they were concerned about the fumes. But there were no reports of sickened residents. As of Tuesday afternoon, oil was reported in about 16 miles of the Kalamazoo River downstream of the spill, said Mary Dettloff, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment. She said state officials were told during a company briefing that an estimated 877,000 gallons spilled -- a figure more than 50,000 gallons higher than the company's public estimate. U.S. Rep. Mark Schauer, D-Mich., said he discussed the spill with President Barack Obama. Schauer called the spill a "public health crisis," and said he plans to hold hearings to examine the response. "The company was originally slow to respond and it is now clear that this is an emergency," Schauer told reporters on a conference call. Obama has pledged a swift response to requests for assistance, White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said. The cause of spill was under investigation. The site is in Calhoun County's Marshall Township, about 60 miles southeast of Grand Rapids. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm activated the State Emergency Operations Center. Granholm toured the area by helicopter Tuesday evening, then met with state and federal officials for a briefing. She said more resources should be devoted to cleaning up the spill. "From my perspective, the response has been anemic," she said. Enbridge said it had about 200 employees and contractors working on the spill. Local, state and federal agencies also were involved, and the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation. The pipeline was shut down Monday and isolation valves were closed, stopping the source of the oil, the company said. The Kalamazoo River eventually bisects the city of Kalamazoo and meanders to Saugatuck, where it empties into Lake Michigan. Officials didn't think the oil would spread past Morrow Lake, which has a dam upstream of Kalamazoo, Dettloff said. The river already faced major pollution issues. An 80-mile segment of the river and five miles of a tributary, Portage Creek, were placed on the federal Superfund list of high-priority hazardous waste sites in 1990. The Kalamazoo site also includes four landfills and several defunct paper mills. The Michigan Department of Community Health warned the public to stay away from the creek and river during the cleanup. It also said people shouldn't eat fish from the waterways or have contact with the water, and farmers and homeowners who use the water for irrigation or livestock should stop.

 Caption Close < i>Buchanan </i> Part of the Indian Point nuclear power plant complex remained offline Sunday after a transformer fire created another problem: thousands of gallons of oil leaking into the Hudson River, officials said. Gov. "There's no doubt that oil was discharged into the Hudson River," Cuomo said. "Exactly how much, we don't know." It could be weeks before Indian Point 3 is reopened again, said a spokesman for Entergy Corp., the plant owner. The transformer at the plant in Westchester County about 30 miles north of midtown Manhattan failed on Saturday evening, causing a fire that forced the automatic shutdown. Cuomo revealed Sunday that even after the blaze on the nonnuclear side of the plant was quickly doused, the heat reignited the fire that was again extinguished. The governor said oil in the transformer had seeped into a holding tank that did not have the capacity to contain all the fluid, which then entered river waters through a discharge drain. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Joseph+Martens%22">Joseph Martens</a> The cleanup should take a day or two, Cuomo said. A spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said several thousand gallons of oil may have overflowed the transformer moat. The reactor itself was deemed safe and stable, said Entergy spokesman The "These situations we take very seriously. Luckily this was not a major situation. But the emergency protocols are very important," Cuomo said Saturday. "I take nothing lightly when it comes to this plant specifically." The transformer at Indian Point 3 takes energy created by the plant and changes the voltage for the grid supplying power to the state. The blaze, which sent black smoke billowing into the sky, was extinguished by a sprinkler system and on-site personnel, Nappi said. He said a foam-like substance containing animal protein and fat was used to put out the fire, leaving an oily sheen on the water that does not harm the environment. He said he cannot confirm that fluid from the transformer leaked beyond the holding tank until a probe is conducted. It was not immediately clear what caused the initial failure. Officials did not know how long the 1,000-megawatt reactor would be down. Nappi estimated it could be "a few weeks" before Indian Point 3 reopened. Cuomo said there had been too many emergencies recently involving Indian Point. Unit 3 was shut down Thursday morning for an unrelated issue — a water leak on the nonnuclear side of the plant. "We have to get to the bottom of this," the governor said. In March, Unit 3 was shut down for a planned refueling that took about a month. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Diane+Screnci%22">Diane Screnci</a> She said there was no impact on the public.

 HIGHLAND — Officials continued to monitor the quality of tap water in Highland Saturday after 4,200 gallons of crude oil spilled into a ditch that empties into Silver Lake, the city’s water source. According to a press release issued on the city’s Facebook page, city officials were notified of the spill at approximately 1:30 p.m. Friday. “City of Highland Fire Department activated their oil spill emergency response plan and deployed an oil containment boom under the Interstate 70 Bridge where the lake narrows in order to protect the City of Highland water source,” the release, issued Friday evening, said. “At this time there are no visible signs of oil in the lake, but oil is visible on the surface of Silver Creek near the IL Route 160 Bridge. “The spill has been reported to Madison County Emergency Management, Illinois Emergency Management, and EPA. At this time, the City of Highland is assisting Plains Pipeline in accessing Silver Creek below the IL Route 160 Bridge so that they can begin their containment and clean-up operations.” The incident occurred at 17720 Bauman Rd. at a pump station for the pipeline that runs from Patoka to Wood River operated by operated by Plains All American Pipeline. Crews immediately began working to keep the spilled oil in place and continue containment and cleanup operations. Twitter users on Saturday reported seeing oil-covered foliage along the creek leading to Silver Lake. The city has increased water-monitoring operations to insure contaminated water isn’t making it to area homes. As of Saturday afternoon, officials said the spill remained contained with no sign of crude making it into Silver Lake. However, the city is blocking any recreational use of the lake as a precaution. Plains All American Pipeline released the following statement Saturday afternoon: “Plains sincerely regrets that this incident has occurred and apologizes for any inconvenience to residents and the impact to the environment. The company has mobilized a full response, and we are committed to doing everything in in our power to minimize the impact of this release. Plains’ objectives remain the safety of response personnel, residents as well as an effective response and remediation effort. “A Unified Command has been established with participation from the U.S. EPA, the City of Highland and Plains. In conjunction with the Unified Command, Plains has mobilized resources including vacuum trucks, protective and absorbent boom, response vessels, a helicopter and more than 100 response personnel. Resources will continue to be assessed and deployed as required by the response. “The flow of oil on the pipeline was stopped yesterday morning and the source was identified as a small-diameter fitting within the pump station. Recent rains carried some of the oil to Silver Creek. Free oil and oil sheen on the water is being contained by protective boom to prevent it from reaching Highland Silver Lake. Additional protective boom has been deployed along the I-70 bridge in the northern portion of the lake, and out of an abundance of caution, protective boom has been placed around the inlet of the receipt point for the water treatment facility located at the southern end of Highland Silver Lake. As a precaution, the police department has temporarily closed the lake to all recreational and sporting activities. “Third-party experts, overseen by U.S. EPA, are performing air and water monitoring and results to date have shown no impact to the public water supply and no air readings that would impact public health. “Plains would like to thank Highland police and fire department personnel as well as the U.S. EPA for their rapid and professional assistance in the ongoing response efforts.” It’s the second incident for the company in recent months. On May 19, crude spilled from a 24-inch Plains All American Pipeline in California into the Pacific Ocean. The company reports that cleanup along shoreline affected by that spill is 95 percent complete. The estimated volume of the release remains unchanged at approximately 100 barrels, or 4,200 gallons, a portion of which was contained at the pump station.

 GOSHEN >> Regional Refuse Disposal District 1, which serves as the municipal recycling and waste collection center for Barkhamsted, New Hartford and Winchester, will be required to come up with funds to remediate a portion of its facility after it housed and shipped PCB-contaminated oil earlier this year, officials said. Jim Hart, the manager of the facility, came before the Northwest Hills Council of Governments to discuss the incident Thursday morning. “One of the services that we provide for our taxpayers is the collection of waste oil, a fairly mundane issue that we’ve been successfully handling for a number of years,” said Hart. “It ran into a significant problem in April, when a DEEP inspector showed up and told us that we were the source of a significant PCB contamination.” Remediating the facility to address the problem will cost “on the order” of $40,000, according to Hart, including attorney’s fees, as the center works to persuade insurers to cover the cost. It also cost approximately $120,000 to remediate a larger facility in New Haven where the waste oil was shipped, according to Hart. The ultimate liability for this expense is still being sorted out. “I’m here today for two reasons: first of all, to make you all, as first selectmen, aware of this potential problem, which, although it’s very infrequent, can be very costly. And at your particular town, you may be able to do things that potentially could catch the problem earlier in the process. It’s virtually impossible to know when somebody is bringing in PCB oil,” said Hart. “The second reason… is a big picture, longer-term effort, which would be to have you, as a significantly large group of towns, communicate with CIRMA and CCM to put together a working group to investigate this… to ultimately provide their customers a rider on their general liability policy (which would allow compensation if preventative steps are taken.) Barbara Henry, the chairman of CIRMA and the first selectman of Roxbury, was in attendance at the meeting Thursday. In the future, according to Hart, waste oil will be tested for contamination by a laboratory before being hauled to a larger collection facility in New Haven, and “a higher level of scrutiny” will be applied to the oil being dropped off. Tests performed at the time of the occurrence, both by the facility and the hauler that transported the oil, were not sensitive enough to pick up the level of PCBs present in the oil.

 Caption Close FAIRFIELD — Toxins known as PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) have been found in some samples of sediment dredged from the Mill River as part of the latest cleanup of the former Exide Battery property on the Post Road. The sediment is stockpiled on the Exide property and poses no danger to residents because of the site controls already in place, according to a statement from the first selectman’s office. The discovery, however, has prompted a mandatory review of the project by the state The agencies will review the new sampling data and require additional authorizations prior to allowing the sediment to be moved from the property to a certified landfill facility. Cleanup of the Exide factory property and the contamination it also caused in the Mill River has been going on for decades. A first attempt at remediation of the Mill River was done in 1983 when about 4,000 yards of contaminated sediment was removed from the river. Ground contaminants were removed between 1987 and 1990. But the current DEEP order was issued in 2008 when it was discovered that those initial efforts failed to reduce the lead levels in the river. There was a long process that involved town officials, residents, DEEP and the property owners to come to an agreement on how much of the contaminated sediment needed to be removed and the mechanics of that process. It is believed the bulk of the lead contamination was caused by spills during the battery-manufacturing process. When the factory was demolished, 13,000 tons of demolition debris, 10,000 tons of contaminated soil and 4,000 feet of contaminated pipes were removed from the Post Road property. The sediment subsequently dredged from the river and de-watered, now sits in large brown sacks piled high on the site, waiting to be moved to an approved disposal site. According to town officials, PCB testing was not previously required based on Exide’s past industrial practices and historical testing on the Mill River sediments revealed only low levels of PCBs “typical of any urban watershed.” It will be up to the DEEP and the EPA if a responsible party for release of the PCBs into the river can be determined, and what the next course of action will be.

 <strong>2003-04-22 04:00:00 PDT Washington</strong> Members of the The panel called for an overhaul of clean air laws to adopt a new performance-based system that would force older power plants to shut down within 10 years unless they install anti-pollution equipment and reduce emissions to meet legal standards. The report also called for more vigorous enforcement of New Source Review regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency and the "Contrary to congressional intent, many large, highly polluting facilities have continued to operate and have expanded their production (and pollution) over the past 25 years without upgrading to cleaner technologies," the report said. "The result: thousands of premature human deaths, and many thousand additional cases of acute illnesses and chronic diseases caused by air pollution." The study, mandated by Congress in September 2000, highlights problems with an enforcement program that has been praised by environmental groups and northeastern state attorneys general as the most effective tool available for combating industrial pollution but criticized by industry and administration officials for being an impediment to energy industry expansion and investment. The Clean Air Act as amended in 1977 requires new plants and utilities to install the best available pollution-control technology. Aging utilities and refineries were exempted by Congress from installing the new technology unless they made improvements to extend a plant's life and thereby create a new source of emissions. The administration contends that the existing program creates too much uncertainty for the industry, and last December it outlined proposals that would allow older coal-fired power plants to do "routine maintenance" and upgrade their facilities -- and most likely increase their emissions -- without having to install costly anti-pollution equipment as they now must do.

 < strong>1995-05-23 04:00:00 PDT FRESNO; BAKERSFIELD COUNTY; RIVERSIDE COUNTY; LOS ANGELES COUNTY</strong> The pesticide, a banned soil fumigant called DBCP, has filtered into ground water in some areas and now exceeds federal standards for safe exposure in about 1,700 wells that serve more than 200,000 people, according to an analysis by a team of researchers at UC-Berkeley's "Pesticide contamination of drinking water poses a significant health risk in agricultural areas of the state," said However, compared with naturally occurring chemicals such as arsenic and radon, the number of cancers that might be caused through drinking water constitute only a "moderate risk," the team found. For every 1,000 cases of cancer caused by natural arsenic in the water, pesticides might cause five, the scientists calculated. But unlike natural carcinogens, the pesticide poses a man-made - and thus entirely avoidable - risk. Northern California water appears unaffected. Ground water in the Northern reaches of the state, as well as any water system that relies on Sierra water, has not suffered pesticide contamination, the scientists said. At least half of the wells supplying Fresno water are contaminated with DBCP. Last week, Other affected towns include Lodi, Modesto, Clovis, Dinuba, Reedley, Tulare, Manteca, Parlier and Atwater. In Southern California, contamination is focused in parts of Riverside, Bakersfield and L.A. counties. Both public and private wells are affected. DBCP was banned in the late 1970s because it caused cancer in rats when ingested in high doses and caused abnormalities in the testes and sterility in small doses in humans. Although DBPC was by far the most prevalent, other banned pesticides identified as potential health risks were ethylene dibromide, found in 100 wells, and 1,2-dichloropropane, found in 35 wells. Some communities have installed filters to clean their water. Others rely on bottled water, although users still can absorb chemicals through their pores when they wash their hands or shower with the bad water. In general, pesticide contamination of ground water is a much more serious problem for Californians than pesticide residues on food, the UC-Berkeley team concluded. "Under normal conditions, the health risks from food are minimal, especially when compared with other sources of pesticide exposure," Pease said. The analysis, entitled "Pesticide Contamination of Groundwater in California," was based on annual state reports that track chemicals in wells and water systems. It was published by the

 California Fish and Game workers yesterday were monitoring a pipeline leak and a tank-car spill in the Sierra Nevada that occurred within a few miles of each other in the past week. The latest incident arose Saturday when a petroleum odor was reported in the area of Summit Creek, near Donner Lake, in Nevada County. An investigation by Fish and Game employees, joined by workers from the state Containment booms and absorption pads were placed at the site, said Fish and Game representatives, who described the problem as "a possible break" in a Santa Fe Pacific pipeline that funnels petroleum products from Reno to the Bay Area. The pipeline was shut down, and an investigation continued last night into the specific petroleum product found at the site. Meanwhile, crews worked to place a dam upstream to prevent runoff into Donner Lake. Less than 10 miles westward, a transfer of fuel from a tank car to a storage tank on the Union Pacific railroad line went awry on February 26, said Fish and Game workers, and 17,500 gallons of red diesel fuel were spilled near Lake Van Norden on the Placer County-Nevada County border. Fish and Game crews established a containment system and stopped the flow into the lake, although a tributary stream was apparently affected, and a meadow leading into the lake was contaminated. Limited access, steep terrain, deep snow and concerns about frostbite and hypothermia hampered workers trying to control contamination, Fish and Game representatives said.

 State and King County officials yesterday were assessing the environmental damage from a pipeline rupture that spewed as much as 200,000 gallons of landfill waste water into an area within 200 feet of the Cedar River northwest of Maple Valley. The leak occurred Saturday night in a pipe carrying liquid from the Cedar Hills Regional Landfill to the county's Renton sewage treatment plant. County spokesman The spill occurred at the intersection of Cedar Grove Road and state Route 169 on vacant property in the Cedar River flood plain. It had been bought by the county for flood control. Brad Bell, operations manager of the King County A berm appeared to have prevented the spill from reaching the Cedar River, although Bell said some of the polluted liquid may have leached through the soil into the river. The state County officials called out an emergency response firm under contract to make emergency repairs, clean up the site and test for contaminants. A truck with a vacuuming device cleaned up the spill. The leak was reported by Maple Valley Fire and Rescue about 6:15 p.m. Saturday, but it took until about 7:15 p.m. to determine the source and until 8 p.m. to shut off the leak, Harris said. Bell said 200,000 gallons was the maximum amount that might have been spilled and it likely was much less. The liquid, called leachate, is rainwater or other liquid that has filtered down through garbage and soil at the Cedar Hills landfill and is collected at the base of the landfill in a piping system. It is then pumped eight miles from the landfill north of Maple Valley to the county's waste water treatment plant in Renton.

 BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A pipeline spill of oilfield wastewater in northwestern North Dakota has affected more cropland than originally reported. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified earlier this month of the 8,400 gallon (31,797 liter) pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Regulators initially said about 1,000 square feet (92.9 square meters) of cropland was affected. The landowner, Sherwood resident Allan Engh, said people involved in the cleanup of the site told him the brine could have contaminated as much as 400,000 square feet (37,161 square meters) of soil. Suess told the Bismarck Tribune that estimate could be accurate but the official number is not yet known. “We know it’s bigger, we know it’s impacting a very large area,” Suess said. Cobra Oil and Gas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) north of Sherwood, and within a 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It's a byproduct of oil and gas development.

 Caption Close Waste ash from hundreds of coal-fired power plants has contaminated groundwater in 39 states with toxic substances such as arsenic, lithium and mercury, according to a The report, released Monday by the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice, highlights more than a dozen instances in which those substances have reached drinking water supplies. The full extent of the effect on drinking water supplies is not known because private sources of drinking water are not tested, the report said. "Virtually all coal plants are poisoning our water," said Abel Russ, who is an author of the study and an attorney with the Environmental Integrity Project. The ponds and landfills used to store coal ash are frequently unlined, allowing toxins to leach into groundwater. The report is based on groundwater monitoring data from more than 4,600 wells. It compared measured levels to drinking water or other standards. Contamination was found in groundwater near 242 of the 265 plants that recently reported data required by the 2015 rule. Fifty-two percent of those sites are contaminated with cancer-causing arsenic, and 60 percent are polluted with lithium, which is linked to neurological damage, according to the report. Last year, The Trump administration finalized new regulations in July but weakened, rather than tightened, some regulations, said Lisa Evans EPA spokesman John Konkus said Monday that the agency is reviewing the report "and cannot comment on its contents yet." He said the monitoring requirement "helps provide transparency and a mechanism to oversee a facility's compliance with the regulations." The report's authors said they're "understating" the contamination, because data is available only on coal ash sites actively in use. Ponds and landfills that hold coal ash but are not receiving new deliveries are not included. "They're not regulated, they're not monitored and we don't know much about them," Russ said of the unregulated pits. <em> The-CNN-Wire</em>

 <strong>1997-08-11 04:00:00 PDT CALIFORNIA</strong> Actually, this is to be expected. Lobbyists are lobbyists. What's surprising is how Gov. Wilson, who intrigued environmentalists earlier this year with promises of a "watershed initiative" to protect coastal waters, is now said to oppose renewal of the legislation that established the Bay Protection and Cleanup Program in 1989. For eight years, the program has managed only to work on research studies of contamination, pollution and poisonous chemicals in the bays and inlets of California. Investigators found dangerously high levels of the banned chemical PCB (polychlorinated biphenys) in San Francisco Bay's surfperch, striped bass, white sturgeon, halibut and white croaker fishes. Confirmed "hot spots" include China Basin, Islais Creek and Warm Water Cove in San Francisco, Oakland's inner harbor, San Leandro Bay, Guadalupe Slough in the South Bay and Peyton Slough near Concord; in the Central Coast area, Actual cleanup work has been stalled, according to the Renewal of the program would be authorized by Wilson's "watershed initiative" for coastal cleanup is probably a victim of his court-ordered decision to repay $1.3 billion in one lump sum to state pension funds. The Bay Protection Program, of course, doesn't cost the taxpayers a cent, because the annual budget of more than $2 million comes from fees paid by polluters. Not surprisingly, the California Environmental Business Coalition opposes AB1479 because it "failed to meet its overly broad objectives and does not represent a cost-effective expenditure of limited resources." Hmmm. Let's see. Because the program has been paralyzed by polluters, it's declared an ineffective failure.

 Say you're walking your dog on Cherry Street just east of Suppose you park your car near Rainier Avenue South in Rainier Beach, and it leaks oil. That, too, can find its way past You don't have to be anywhere near the Duwamish to pollute it. About 32 square miles of this city and Tukwila drain into the Duwamish, including Beacon Hill, the International District, parts of Interstate 5 and Boeing Field. When it rains, pollutants are carried to the Duwamish in stormwater that flows off streets and roofs and parking lots and lawns -- at the rate of about 3 billon to 5 billion gallons a year. Anything that's on the ground washes toward the river. So much polluted water is involved that one tunnel carrying it beneath Beacon Hill is 9 feet wide. This is a key problem in "Why would we spend the money to do a cleanup and get a partially healthy Duwamish River?" asked But holding off on removing decades' worth of pollution in the river doesn't make sense, said state Ecology Department official "That's like dropping a car battery in your garage and not cleaning it up because you know you are going to spill some oil later," Cargill said. Seattle has launched an aggressive campaign of business inspections to keep pollutants out of stormwater. But environmentalists say it fails to strike at one of the most vexing classes of pollutants, phthalates. Cleanup officials don't even know where they are coming from, or how they are getting into stormwater. Pronounced THAL-ates , these chemicals appear to cause malformed penises, undescended testicles and reduced testosterone production in laboratory rats exposed to large doses. In the bloodstream of pregnant women, even at much lower levels, phthalates correlate with impaired testicular function and subtle genital changes in baby boys to make them a bit more like baby girls. One of the most common phthalates also has been associated in humans with shortened pregnancies, and recently phthalates in adult men were found to be correlated with bigger midsections and a prediabetic condition. Children are particularly vulnerable, scientists reported this year after reviewing numerous studies. They said tests show that "tolerable intake (in) children is exceeded to a considerable degree, in some instances up to twentyfold." Phthalates have many uses, but they are most copiously employed to soften vinyl and other plastics. From the shower curtain you push aside in the morning to the toys your kids play with in the tub at night, consumers are confronted with phthalates all over. Worldwide, some 4 million tons are produced each year. Phthalates don't build up in humans or animals, but they are so widespread that everything is Recently a consortium of local government officials studying the problem concluded that they can't really do anything about phthalates as far as the Duwamish River is concerned. The levels there violate state standards, they said, and they may continue to pour in, but they stressed the need to get the PCBs out first and come back to this problem later. Environmentalists are concerned that later could mean much, much later. Trim says a much more aggressive approach is needed, starting with a major research effort in the next few years, before the Duwamish cleanup plan is finished in 2009, to find the source of the phthalates. Early this month City Councilman "If this is such a significant input into the Duwamish River," she asks, "what about in your home?" What does Seattle Public Utilities stormwater inspector Those are fine tools -- but they are not going to help in the fight against phthalates, environmentalists point out. But still, Stewart believes the inspection program is worthwhile. She's found places with buckets of antifreeze, oily parts, partially full waste drums and much more, all exposed to the weather where they could leak onto the ground and, ultimately, into the Duwamish. And she finds some businesses fail to clean their catch basins, meaning pollutants get whisked toward local waterways instead of settling out of the water. "We do inspections because education is a big part of (pollution) control," Stewart said between inspections of a sidecar manufacturer and the School Board's repair shops. "We never have the same day twice. There's so many different types of businesses in Seattle." Environmentalists, though, call for a coordinated look at every drainage basin to find the source of pollution, with technicians working their way up drainage pipes taking samples and tracing the source of chemicals coming out the end of the pipe. That would be even more expensive than the intense inspection program, though. Trim points to the tens of millions spent already on planning the cleanup of mud in the river. "They have not put an equal amount of effort and money into pollution prevention and trying to track down where the chemicals are coming from, and part of that is because Ecology doesn't have a budget to do this," she said.

 For 30 years, a handful of chemists in two small buildings above the The operation doesn't even come close to violating federal safety standards, and has cut its emissions 90 percent in the past eight years. So it was with some surprise that "What we do hurts nobody," Williams said. His facility assists the development of drugs to fight cancer, AIDS and other diseases by making radioactive versions of compounds for other scientists, who use them to trace what happens to the substances in cells, organs or other biological systems. In September, however, the The lab, in turn, is hoping to satisfy critics by assembling an outside review team. The group could include representatives of the <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Gene+Bernardi%22">Gene Bernardi</a> Bernardi has lived in Berkeley all her 66 years. When she recently discovered that radioactive tritium was venting from a tall pipe at the lab, she was appalled. She worries about children nearby, and vegetables grown in hillside gardens. And she worries that goats that graze in the hills to control poison oak could eat vegetation contaminated by tritium, and if anybody eats cheese made from the goat's milk, he or she could get sick. "Some people in Berkeley don't want to admit this, but everything has a risk," said The "stack," on a grassy hill behind the labs, is a fat vent about 30 feet high at the edge of a grove of eucalyptus trees. Air from the tritium facility, as well as other buildings nearby, is vented through it. About 350 feet away is the Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen. Ordinary hydrogen has one particle in its nucleus, a proton. Tritium has three: a proton and two neutrons. Small quantities form naturally from cosmic rays hitting the upper atmosphere. The Department of Energy also manufactures it, mostly for nuclear weapons, with some used for basic research. It decays with a half life of 12.4 years and gives off electrons in a form of radioactivity called beta decay. The beta particles are not very powerful -- a sheet of paper will stop them. But, if tritium gets incorporated into living tissue, it can possibly cause cancers. It is therefore possible for tritium from the facility to get into somebody's liver or other organ, and cause a tumor. But lab workers say that compared to other things that get into people's bodies, risk from their tritium is far too low for worry. "Is this safe? I'd say so absolutely," said He provides numbers. A curie is a measure of radioactivity. Federal drinking water standards allow 20,000 picocuries, or trillionths of a curie, per liter of water. Chicken Creek, which flows near the facility, has never had more than six percent of that limit. The lab's safety workers calculate that the most a person could get in a year near the stack adds about four hundredths of one percent to the radiation he or she would get from other sources. Minute amounts of tritium have been measured in the leaves and soil in the grove. Rain water in a gauge on the hill was found, in one recent measurement, to violate federal standards for drinking water -- standards that do not apply, however, to the rainwater. McGraw said the problem, though, is not whether people believe the numbers. "It is philosophical," he said. "They (the opposition) want no dose at all." Williams and three chemists who work for him do the contract work for outside clients, usually university researchers or pharmaceutical companies. A visit finds four laboratory rooms in a plain, two-story cinder block building. About once a year, a truck arrives with a new supply of tritium. The shipping container is a reinforced steel cylinder as tall as a man. Deep inside multiple layers of padding -- the box can hit a mountain, inside a crashing airplane, and not break -- is a steel canister the size of a slender thermos bottle. Inside that is a single gram of tritium gas. Williams' staff puts the cylinder in a sealed box, about five feet on a side, made of glass walls with rubber sleeves and gloves fixed to ports, so that the mazes of valves, glass tubing, and other chemical equipment can be manipulated. They transfer the gram of tritium into a 2 1/2-inch-long canister of depleted, or mildly radioactive, uranium. The tritium binds with the uranium metal. At room temperature, it goes nowhere. When they need some tritium, they heat the canister and tritium flows out a tube and into reaction chambers where the tritium reacts with whatever a client wants labeled. Thus labeled, the molecules can be tracked in biological systems, either laboratory tissue cultures, or animals. Scientists can see where their candidate drugs go, what reactions they affect, and how long they last. It is an essential part of molecular biology. "If it was that dangerous, none of us would do it (work with tritium)," said Marcus F. Boehm, who used to do post-doctoral work there when he was on the UC Berkeley staff. He now works for a San Diego pharmaceutical company, and still uses it regularly. "None of us are stupid, and biologists -- every one that I know -- do work that relies in part on radioisotope studies." And to this, Janice Thomas, a member of the committee of opponents, says that researchers who feel safe around tritium "wouldn't be the first scientists to be in denial, to be the first scientists to get cancer, or infertility."

The "The walls would erode away, and we couldn't control the water," Edwards said. The bureau didn't test for selenium concentrations before releasing the water, Edwards said. Selenium, an element found in shale and petroleum, is toxic to fish and wildlife in Mud Slough, at the end of the drain, and in the San Joaquin River, which flows into the Delta and San Francisco Bay. "We would think that with the dilution of flood water, it wouldn't be toxic," Edwards said. The bureau did not formally seek permission to open the drain, said The board, which controls toxic chemicals in the San Joaquin River, began sampling Thursday but hasn't yet received results. The regulators are concerned that the selenium will spread and further contaminate the system, Wass said. "Maybe we all could have had more foresight to predict such a catastrophic storm," Wass said. "It hit us hard." Releasing the water somewhat slowly would relieve the pressure in the drain without sweeping Kesterson's selenium-laden sediments into the slough. In some parts of the drain, the sediments contain so much selenium that they are classified as hazardous waste. Gary Bobker, a policy analyst at the "Rain is a natural part of California.

 Caption Close DETROIT (AP) — Flint children under the age of 6 had significantly higher blood-lead levels after the city switched its water source in 2014 to save money, according to a report released Friday by U.S. disease experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's report said the likelihood a child would have a concerning blood-lead level — at least 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood — was about 50 percent higher after the April 2014 switch from Detroit's water system to the Flint River. Flint used the water for 18 months, during which lead leached from old pipes in homes, businesses and schools because the water wasn't treated to control corrosion. The city switched back to Detroit's system in October. "This crisis was entirely preventable, and a startling reminder of the critical need to eliminate all sources of lead from our children's environment," Patrick Breysse, director of CDC's National Center for Environmental Health, said in a statement. About 9,600 children younger than 6 years old lived in homes served by Flint's water system, the report said. Among them, about 7,300 received nearly 9,700 blood lead tests before, during and after the water source switch. Children can develop learning disabilities and behavior problems from lead exposure, even in low levels. According to the CDC, blood-lead testing in Michigan is targeted toward children at or below the poverty level and those enrolled in Medicaid. All children on Medicaid are required to receive blood-lead screenings when they're 1 and 2 years old, or 3 and 6 years old if previous screenings weren't done. The lead-level test periods were: the year leading up to the initial switch; between April 2014 and the January 2015 release of a water advisory because of high levels of disinfectant byproducts; between the advisory and return to Detroit water; and after the return to Detroit. After last fall, children's blood-lead levels dropped to what had been found before the switch to the Flint River. The study underscores the need for a "big, public health discussion" about lead, Breysse told The Associated Press. A recent national health survey estimated that a half-million children under 6 have elevated blood-lead levels in the area of concern and 4 million U.S. households have lead-paint hazards. "We have concerns being raised across the country," he said. Officials noted some limitations with the Flint findings: They couldn't account for all factors that might have contributed to a child's lead exposure, such as whether lead-based paint was present in the children's homes or whether a decline in blood-lead levels post-return to Detroit water was at least partly because of the increased consumption of bottled water. Still, the authors say the analysis suggests increased lead exposure related to consuming contaminated water in Flint. Marc Edwards, an environmental engineering expert at Virginia Tech who helped uncover the lead scandal, said the study corroborates his work and that of Flint pediatrician Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha. "It's a solid report confirming the veracity of our warnings of adverse health effects from water lead exposure in Flint (in) August 2015, as well as Dr. Mona's studies of elevated blood lead in September," he wrote in an email to the AP. The report comes a day after federal officials announced filtered tap water was safe for everyone in Flint, lifting a recommendation that pregnant women, nursing mothers and children under 6 drink bottled water to avoid lead exposure. The announcement was based on tests of filters that have been distributed for months for free by the state of Michigan. In March, a state task force that investigated the Flint crisis concluded that it was a "case of environmental injustice" in a poor, majority black city.

 More than 300 Texas factories and utilities routinely dump more pollution in rivers and streams than allowed by their permits, according to a new study by a consumer action group. The analysis was done by Environment Texas Research & Policy Center, the environmental arm of the Texas Public Interest Research Group. The report, titled "Troubled Waters," resulted from an analysis of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. It found 348 Texas factories and utilities exceeded the amount of pollution allowed under their Clean Water Act permits more than 2,000 times over an 18-month period. "It pays to pollute," Adam Schurle with Environment Texas, said at a news conference in San Antonio on Thursday, when the report was released. " The good news is that Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is considering changes to their enforcement program." A 2003 state auditor's study, reviewing 80 cases, found that polluters benefited by more than $8.6 million by not complying with regulations, but that the state fined them less than $1.7 million. John Sadlier, director of the TCEQ's enforcement division, acknowledged in Friday editions of the San Antonio Express-News that the profit issue is "on everyone's mind. " The agency's commissioners will discuss it next week. The report covered the 18 months from July 1, 2003, to Dec. 31, 2004. It examined facilities across country, focusing on Texas. Harris County, where 99 plants exceeded pollution allowed by their permits, accounted for the most Texas facilities on the list. Harris also led the nation among counties with the highest percentage of violators. The pollution being released included fecal contamination from sewage treatment plants, oil and grease and even dangerous chemicals from industrial plants. ___ _ On the Net:

 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Up to 60 percent of the groundwater monitoring wells sampled across a swath of central and eastern Minnesota are contaminated with nitrates well above the safe drinking water standard, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency said Thursday in a report that highlights growing concerns about the state's drinking water. Some of the affected cities include Becker, Clear Lake, Cold Spring, Hastings, Goodhue, Adrian and Park Rapids, the report said. They lie in a region of shallow sand and gravel aquifers. A 2014 report from the Minnesota Department of Health estimated the treatment costs statewide were in the billions of dollars, including $9 million for Hastings and $11 million for Park Rapids. Nitrate contamination can lead to illnesses such as "blue baby syndrome," a fatal blood disorder for infants. The chemicals can enter groundwater from sources such as animal manure and agricultural fertilizers. The safe level for drinking water is considered 10 milligrams per liter. Many smaller communities are spending millions of dollars to address the problem, the MPCA report said. Their options have including distributing bottled water, drilling new wells and building new treatment plants. "This report underscores the urgent need to ensure that all Minnesotans have clean water," Gov. Mark Dayton said in a statement. He added that he looks forward to discussing the report and the state's other "serious water quality challenges" at his Governor's Water Summit on Saturday. The 25-page report, which the Legislature requested in 2013, said groundwater provides nearly 75 percent of Minnesotans with their drinking water, while nearly 90 percent of the water used to irrigate crops also comes from underground. MPCA Commissioner John Linc Stine stressed the need for more emphasis on prevention. "It costs between 10 to 30 times more to fix contaminated groundwater than to prevent contamination in the first place," Stine said in the statement. The report detailed the problems from human-caused pollutants such as road salt, antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals, and volatile organic compounds, as well as naturally-occurring contaminants like arsenic, manganese and radium. Long-term exposure to arsenic and radium can cause cancer, while manganese can put infants at risk of neurological problems. The report also lists 30 recommendations, including stable funding for groundwater protection programs, more research on the impacts of contaminants on human health and better application practices for nitrogen and manure fertilizers. _ _ _ Online: MPCA Groundwater Protection Recommendations: https://www.pca.state.mn.us/news/contaminated-groundwater-concerns-mount-minnesota

 Levels of dioxins and other toxins in the Houston Ship Channel haven't diminished under an intensive cleanup that included closing industrial plants, leaving scientists puzzled about other sources of the pollution. Results from University of Houston researchers show that dioxin, a group of 75 related chemicals that may cause cancer, exceeded standards in more than 80 percent of the water samples. Tests for the chemicals in sediment found it above normal 83 percent of the time. Researchers who tested fish, blue crabs, sediment and water in 2002 and 2003 presented the results last week to a group of state, local and company officials. Particularly alarming to researchers was that levels in fish had not changed, or were higher, than a decade ago. Eating fish is the primary way humans are exposed to dioxin. "We have exceedances just about everywhere," Hanadi Rifai, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the university which is conducting the research for the state, told the Houston Chronicle in Tuesday's editions. Formerly regarded as one of the nation's most polluted waterways, the channel section most tainted with dioxin was a stretch of several miles between Greens and Carpenter bayous, which are home to numerous refineries and chemical plants, researchers found. "The fact that there is so much of an exceedance means we are looking at a pervasive issue, instead of a historic problem," said Rifai. The research's goal was to determine how much dioxin can continue to enter the Ship Channel while making fish safe to eat. The state health department first warned in 1990 against eating more than 8 ounces a month of certain species of fish in the waterway to Upper Galveston Bay. Environmental laws since then have clamped down on air and water pollution, and paper pulp mills, which generated massive amounts of dioxin in the paper bleaching process, also closed. "The trend is no change. There should have been changes," Lial Tischler, an environmental engineer who represents the East Harris County Manufacturer's Association, said. "The theory was that the pulp mills were the big sources, and those were corrected in the 1990s." Shutting down pulp and paper mills has worked in other state waterways polluted with dioxin. Levels of the chemical in fish on the Neches and Brazos rivers dipped to safe levels in two years, Tischler said. Rifai, who has tested all of the obvious sources, will hunt for more over the next two years. The research isn't expected to end until September 2005. Burning trash and medical waste are other sources, along with rain and dust laced with dioxin from smokestacks. Tainted runoff is also a big contributor, the study found. "It boils down to how do the fish get the dioxin," she said. "That pathway is real critical to our understanding." Routine channel dredging could be contributing to the dioxin problem, some researchers believe. "A concern of ours is how much dredging has impacted this study," said Jack Wahlstrom, who manages the Washburn Tunnel facility for the Gulf Coast Waste Disposal Authority. The agency, which treats industrial waste, was blamed in the 1990s for the levels of dioxins it was discharging. Rifai was urged by other advisers to examine groundwater, ship emissions and the mud-laden dump sites along the channel where dredged material is placed. "Dredging operations do not create or generate dioxin; any dioxins in the disposal areas are not the result of port operations. We have no evidence that dredge disposal sites are a source of dioxin," said Tom Kornegay, executive director of the Port of Houston Authority. The state is required by the Clean Water Act to develop total maximum daily loads for the 200 to 300 waterways that are too polluted to support fishing, swimming and other uses. Scientists are planning or working on 83 waterways, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The five-year study is expected to cost $5 million. Information from: Houston Chronicle

Dalton made his statement during the public comment period of Thursday night's public meeting in Freeland on the levels of dioxin found along the Tittabawassee River floodplain.</strong></font>  FREELAND – Many questions swirled throughout a four-hour meeting about dioxin Thursday night. Most conflict arose regarding a proposed health study and who might fund it – The Dow Chemical Co., the likely source of dioxin contamination. The crowd numbered 200, including state, county and township officials, area environmentalists, a couple of legislators and three Tittabawassee Township police officers in the back. No one from The Dow Chemical Co. was apparent. Dave Johnson, deputy director for public health and chief medical executive of the Michigan Department of Community Health, outlined his agency’s proposal for a comprehensive dioxin exposure and health effects study. Specifically, it would address whether blood sample levels of dioxin in Midland and Tittabawassee River floodplain residents are higher than those of other people, whether there is a correlation between blood sample levels and dioxin levels in the soil, and whether Midland and floodplain residents have elevated rates of diseases scientifically linked to dioxins. The proposal includes oversight by a scientific advisory committee, with scientists nominated by the MDCH, Department of Environmental Quality, Dow and the citizens who petitioned for the health consultation that got sampling started. A fifth scientist would be chosen in consultation with the other four. Oversight also would come from a stakeholder advisory committee. "All of these meetings that they would conduct should be open meetings," Johnson added. Sally Regelski said she doesn't like Dow representation on the boards, but she didn't know if others agreed. Others shouted and applauded in response. "The draft proposal really is intended as a draft," Johnson said. He pointed out that while some feel strongly that community representation should exclude Dow, others consider Dow part of the community. David Riddick said he doesn't understand how Dow, with a clear stake in the outcome of a health study, could be allowed to fund it. "To me, this is backwards. This is not the way you do these things," he said. It is the state's job to investigate, he said, and if Dow is found culpable, take the company's money then. Dioxin sampling is expensive – about $1,000 per sample. In many cases, samples are taken at three depths at each site. Andrew Hogarth, assistant division chief of the DEQ’s remediation and redevelopment division, estimated after the meeting that Phase I and II soil sampling has cost his agency $300,000. Area environmentalists, who petitioned for the health consultation that led to soil sampling, were angry that they learned from a Freedom of Information Act request that Dow representatives flew to Atlanta in April and presented the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry with a proposal for a health study. "The fact that they proposed a study is absolutely fact," Johnson said. However, he said, the DEQ and MDCH took that idea, developed it more fully and clarified what would need to happen to make it work – most importantly, what kind of input would be needed. "I have no problem with Dow funding this. Polluters should pay," said Michelle Hurd-Riddick of the Lone Tree Council, which offered a counterproposal. The environmental group is asking the ATSDR and MDCH to convene a conversation among stakeholders to review sampling thus far and recommend further sampling; review data on other exposure pathways and recommend further work; help develop recommendations to reduce long-term and short-term exposures; explore the merits of an exposure study for local residents; and explore the merits of developing a health registry for local residents. Diane Hebert, one of the petitioners, was upset there were 12 drafts of the health study before she had the opportunity to become involved. "We have begged for participation," she said. She asked for help from legislators, saying, "Dow has not proven that all the dioxin is historical." She urged the audience to oppose any study Dow has developed, saying maybe if she had been involved from the beginning she would feel differently. " This is how I would like to give my comments," she said, tearing up paper and dropping it on the front table. New voices also were heard. Midlander Carol Chisholm said, "I don't trust Dow, and I don't want them involved in anything to do with this problem." Diane Dalton, an educator in Saginaw County, asked whether the state has pursued grant money for a health study, or other sources besides Dow. Yes, Johnson said. "The answers aren't easy when you're talking about millions and millions of dollars like this," he said. "We'll continue to explore other sources of funding." This didn't please John Taylor of River Watch, who asked whether it was true that if Dow hadn't stepped forward and offered funding, the ATSDR would be paying for a study. Alan Yarborough of the ATSDR said his agency normally funds projects in the range of a couple of hundred thousand dollars. " Currently, within our budget we do not fund any multimillion-dollar studies such as being envisioned here." In addition, this is earlier in the process than ATSDR usually conducts studies, he said. Generally the agency waits until diseases are shown to be statistically high, and there is not yet information linking local dioxin contamination to disease, he explained. ––––– River Watch meets at 6 p.m. the third Monday of each month at Green Point Environmental Learning Center in Saginaw County, and can be reached at (989) 781-4518.

 EAST HADDAM -- Just last month, First Selectman Mark Walter signed the Salmon River Watershed Compact, an agreement between several area towns to protect the pristine river from critical threats such as housing and road construction. Now a group of residents are questioning whether he and other local officials were serious about it. They fear construction of a proposed road and housing development off Orchard Road will pollute local wetlands that connect to the river. "This is a test to see if the towns really are interested in saving the river," said Margaret O'Brian, a resident of Orchard Road. "Those homes will disrupt everything. The area is flooded every spring." Alan Hanks has proposed Morgan Estates, which would be located on a planned cul-de-sac between Church on the Move and the O'Brian's house. The development would consist of seven four-bedroom houses. The inland wetlands and watercourses commission held a public hearing on June 9. They have the power to accept or reject the application. They will also get an opinion from the conservation commission. If the proposal passes muster there, it will go on to the planning and zoning commission for final approval. These agencies, not Walter, make the decisions about proposed development. About 20 residents attended the meeting at the Grange Hall, which has no air conditioning. At the meeting, Roger Nemergut, an environmental engineer, presented Hanks' proposal. Reports from the Eastern Connecticut Conservation District and other groups prompted Hanks to modify the original design. Nemergut said Hanks will take measures to improve drainage, such as replacing 15-inch diameter pipes with 24-inch ones. "The existing system on Orchard Road was installed five years ago," Nemergut said. "It was not designed for future development." Other proposed measures to mitigate environmental impact include an individual planting plan for each rain garden, along with swales, easements, using a more porous pavement and natural water filtration systems. The homeowners' association will be responsible for maintaining some of these things. Jodie Chase, a plant technologist hired by Hanks, said that the population of box turtles in the area can be protected by various measures, including fences and educating residents. She said a project done at a 280-unit apartment complex in another town protected box turtles there. But not everyone was impressed. O'Brian and her neighbors, Michael Harris and Don Oats, have hired experts of their own who refuted the plan. Mark Godin, one of their experts, said Hank's modifications do not address the issues and, in some cases, do not conform to state guidelines. "You would need multiple revisions and an alteration of the plan," he said. "The plan does not meet public health, storm drainage or your guideline to protect the wetlands," Godin told the commission. One of Godin's critiques was that some conservation easements were not identified on all maps, which mean the contractor might not know they are supposed to be there. These easements would reduce impact on the sensitive wetlands, but they have to be clearly marked on a map, he said. "The biggest problem is the wetlands when the contractor is there alone," he said. "Don't leave important decisions up to the contractor." Godin also had a list of details relating to the catch basins, rain gardens and storm-water runoff that he feels still need to be addressed before the project can be approved. Greg Coleman, a resident, doubted the homeowners' association would maintain the systems. "Years from now this commission will be gone," he said. "Who will make sure the maintenance will be done?" The commission closed the hearing and is expected to discuss the proposal at its next meeting. The Salmon River Watershed Compact that Walter and other area officials signed last month was the result of a year-long project involving town leaders, the state Department of Environmental Protection and representatives of area land trusts and other preservation groups, such as The Nature Conservancy. At a workshop in April, they identified four critical threats to the river. These included housing and urbanizing, which creates impervious surfaces that increase runoff to wetlands, often carrying sediments and contaminants. In addition, clearing of land for buildings breaks up forests. Another threat is road construction and maintenance, since roads are conduits for sand sediment and pollution and watercourse crossing can block passage of fish and wildlife. Other threats were increasing demand for water and dams that remain in the river. O'Brian said she and her concerned neighbors have talked to local groups such as the East Haddam Land Trust, SOLAR and the local Earth Charter group about saving the land, but no formal proposals have been made yet. "We want to propose an alternative," she said. "We would like Mr. Hanks to sell that parcel to a conservation group so it can be kept as a preserve."

 HONG KONG -- A food importer has been fined 15,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,923) for polluting a river with a mayonnaise salad dressing that spilled from a dropped carton, a company spokeswoman said. The dressing was full of highly concentrated organic matters that could have "bleached the river completely," The importer, A High Court judge rejected the company's argument in June and ordered Sims to pay up, Chu said. The judge had said that instead of spraying the dressing with water, which flushed it into the nearby Shing Mun River, Sims workers could have covered up the mess with sand or wiped it away with cloth after the spill. The plastic carton that was dropped contained bottles filled with 20 gallons of dressing, Chu said. Sims Trading won't contest the court's judgment and has revised its procedures for handling discharge, Chu said. The case came to light in a report on Hong Kong's 771 pollution convictions in 2002.

 Yegor Aleyev | TASS (Getty Images) Yegor Aleyev | TASS (Getty Images) Caption Close Yegor Aleyev | TASS (Getty Images) The Illinois Department of Public Health is reporting five cases of multi-drug resistant salmonella infantis illness. This is part of a multi-state outbreak, which includes 92 cases in 29 states and is being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The initial investigation indicates a link to raw chicken. Nearly 90 percent of cases report preparing or eating chicken products that were purchased raw, including ground chicken, chicken pieces and whole chicken. “IDPH is working with our partners to investigate this multistate outbreak of Salmonella infections linked to raw chicken products,” Illinois Department of Public Health Director Nirav D. Shah said. “This outbreak is a reminder to always handle raw chicken carefully and to cook chicken to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent food poisoning.” Most people affected by salmonella develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after eating food contaminated by the bacteria. The illness usually lasts four to seven days and most people recover without treatment. However, diarrhea for some people may be so severe that they need to be hospitalized. The CDC has indicated there have been more hospitalizations with this outbreak than typically seen. The elderly, infants, and those with compromised immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. The outbreak strain was identified in live chickens and many types of raw chicken products, indicating it might be widespread in the chicken industry. The CDC continues to investigate the outbreak. This outbreak is a reminder to follow food safety guidelines. When handling raw chicken, follow these steps to help prevent salmonella: • Wash hands before and after preparing or eating food, after contact with animals, and after using the restroom or changing diapers. Salmonella infections can spread from one person to another if hands have salmonella germs on them. • Chicken should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees to kill harmful germs. Leftovers should be reheated to 165 degrees. Use a food thermometer to check and place it in the thickest part of the food. • Don’t spread germs from raw chicken around food preparation areas. Don’t wash raw poultry before cooking; germs can splash around your kitchen. Thoroughly wash hands, counters, cutting boards, and utensils with warm, soapy water after they touch raw chicken. Use a separate cutting board for raw chicken and other raw meats if possible. • The CDC does not recommend feeding raw diets to pets. Germs like salmonella in raw pet food can make pets sick and people also can get sick by handling the raw food or cleaning up after a pet. For more information, go to the

 Caption Close JBS Tolleson Inc., a Tolleson, Arizona, establishment, is recalling more than 6.5 million pounds of beef products that may be contaminated with salmonella, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service. The items, including ground beef, were packaged on various dates from July 26 to Sept. 7. The products subject to recall bear establishment number “Est. 267” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations and institutions nationwide. The Food Safety and Inspection Service was notified in September of an investigation of salmonella Newport illnesses. The service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health and agriculture partners have now determined that raw ground beef was the probable source of the reported illnesses. The investigation has identified 57 people from 16 states with illness onset dates ranging from Aug. 5 to Sept. 6. Products sold in Illinois and Missouri include Grass Run Farms Natural Beef. Consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. The most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts four to seven days. Most people recover without treatment. In some people, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness.

 A company that makes salt in ponds ringing the Bay violated environmental law by contaminating water on the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, a federal judge has ruled. U.S. District Judge Charles Legge issued a summary judgment this week in favor of local environmentalists who argued that Cargill Inc., one of nation's largest privately held corporations, was liable for violations of the federal Clean Water Act. The plaintiffs said violations occurred over at least a five-year period, and could result in fines of up to $25,000 a day. "We were surprised and disappointed by the judge's ruling, and we are considering an appeal," Cargill said. The BayKeeper, a watchdog group, and Committee to Complete the Refuge, a citizens organization that lobbies to add land to the local wildlife refuge, sued Cargill and its Cargill Salt division in 1996. They asked a judge to rule that Cargill was breaking the law by leaking pollutants from a 10-acre waste pile into a five-acre pond - contaminants that they said threatened wildlife and flowed into the Bay. They said Cargill failed to obtain a permit for the waste pile, which operated as an illegal dump and grew in size as Cargill accumulated salt refining and other wastes on the 21,000-acre wildlife refuge near Newark. Cargill had once owned some of the land but sold it to the wildlife refuge, retaining an easement for the pile, subject to federal environmental laws. "This stuff is ugly," said Michael Lozeau, BayKeeper's chief, who also patrols the Bay in a boat looking for pollution. "They're gray piles of mud and debris, including salt refining mud, discarded plastic, paper and salt shaker tops leaking heavy metals into a pond right next to Mowry Slough," Lozeau said. The lawsuit alleges that the waste pile's discharge contaminated the pond with chromium, copper, nickel and other toxic metals at levels exceeding standards set by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The pond flows into Mowry Slough, home to hundreds of species of birds and other animals. Harbor seals use the slough as a primary pupping ground. Cargill had argued that the pond on the wildlife refuge, which is not a working salt pond, is not a part of U.S. waters protected by the Clean Water Act. Cargill also said the plaintiffs had no standing to sue. Jill Singleton, a Cargill spokeswoman, said that as recently as 1996 the regional water board investigators inspected the area and found no significant problems with the pond - either with metal concentrations or with Cargill not having a permit. Cargill can appeal - or could settle the lawsuit by agreeing to clean up the waste, restore the waters and perhaps pay some penalties. The law covers five years of violations. The maximum civil fine is $25,000 a day, but judges rarely ask for the maximum penalty in such cases.&lt;

 Caption Close BARRY — School officials are reaching out to parents and students after food offered during a taste testing was recalled days later because of potential Listeria contamination. No sicknesses have been reported. Listeriosis can result in a serious infection and causes about 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths each year in the United State. Pregnant women, newborns, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk. Western School District administrators sent a letter to parents last week after a broccoli slaw that was served Oct. 16- 17 was recalled days later. Superintendent Jessica Funk said the slaw it wasn’t clear how many people ate the slaw. It was served at schools in Barry and Kinderhook. “Everyone in the district is invited to take a part in the taste-testing,” Funk said. “Anyone could have eaten it.” Funk said the district has been having taste-testings while getting a sense of foods students and staff members would like to see on the menu next year. According to the letter, the slaw was “an optional choice and was not served with the regular breakfast or lunch-time meal.” Kohls, Western’s food distributor, announced the recall Thursday and Funk said the district immediately began disposing of the slaw. The Pike County Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were notified of the exposure. “Western takes the health and safety of every child seriously and has taken every precaution to dispose of the contaminated product and to ensure that it will not be used at Western in the future,” the school said in its letter. Symptoms can take several days to a month to appear and can include fever, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhea, confusion and convulsions.

 Out-of-order signs on some sinks and water fountains at North Greene Elementary School keep the fixtures dry, even though the school recently completed renovations that replaced much of the school’s plumbing. That was right before testing showed elevated levels of lead in the school’s water. Now school officials are awaiting the results of additional tests to see if efforts to resolve the problem have worked, North Greene Superintendent Mark Scott said. “We replaced pipes and all water fountains during the renovations,” Scott said. Then Ideal Environmental Engineering ran state-mandated lead tests, which showed 11 of 31 tested sites in the school with lead contamination, six of them above the 5 parts per billion at which schools are required to report the results to parents. “There is no safe level of lead,” said Melaney Arnold, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public Health. “The 5 parts per billion signifies the level for which schools must notify individuals.” Five drinking fountains at North Greene Elementary tested at 9.04 ppb, 6.40 ppb, 6.9 ppb, 10.1 ppb and 18.8 ppb. A sink in a pre-kindergarten room also tested high, at 5.01 ppb. Armed with the test results, the North Greene district contacted CTS Group, the company that completed the renovations. “They came in and flushed all of our sinks, fountains and plumbing,” Scott said. “CTS said some of the stuff had settled in the pipes and it hadn’t been properly flushed before the testing.” Ideal is set to return to North Greene Elementary this month or in early March to retest the school’s water. Until then, the school will keep those brand-new fountains and sinks dry. “We’re sure that the tests will come back clean,” Scott said. “We are just waiting for the testing to verify that.” A test in September in Jacksonville School District 117 did not register any levels above 5 ppb, though four testing sites out of 100 showed some levels of lead. One site at South Jacksonville Elementary School reported a 3.68 ppb reading, a North Elementary School site had a 2.73 ppb reading, a Washington Elementary School site had a 4.56 ppb reading and a site at Murrayville-Woodson Elementary School had a reading of 2.06 ppb. Legislation passed a year ago mandates the testing of all water used for drinking or cooking purposes in Illinois schools. School districts must report test results to the Illinois Department of Public Health and implement plans to clean the water systems, if necessary. West Grade School in the Pikeland School District had five sites that showed levels of lead, with one at 7.65 ppb. The other four sites were under 5 ppb, at 2.05, 3.46, 3.67 and 2.03 ppb. Schools are required to mitigate any problems to ensure the health of children and staff members, Arnold said. “Children exposed to high lead levels tend to suffer from lifelong complications that affect their ability to think, learn or behave,” Arnold said. “Risk will vary, however, depending on the individual, the circumstances, and the amount of water consumed. For example, infants who drink formula prepared with lead-contaminated water may be at a higher risk because of the large volume of water they consume relative to their body size.” While the IDPH has not received final numbers, Arnold said the department seen a higher number of schools with lead found in the water. “We’re still collecting data from schools and do not yet have the ability to do a complete analysis, but we are seeing schools reporting elevated lead levels,” Arnold said.

Speaking at the University of Albany's Cancer Research Center, Schumer said he received a letter last week from EPA Assistant Administrator David Ross, who wrote that the agency "intends to establish" a standard — called a  maximum contaminant level, or MCL —  for certain types of chemicals classified as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. One such type of that chemical, called PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, had contaminated drinking water in Hoosick Falls and Peterburgh in Rensselaer County. A manufacturing plant operated by Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics in Hoosick Falls, which has been a focus of the contamination, was declared a Superfund site in 2017. PFOA was used at the plant for decades, including by companies that operated the plant before Saint-Gobain purchased it in the late 1990s. "By the end of this year, the EPA will propose a regulatory determination, which is the next step in the Safe Drinking Water Act process for establishing an MCL" on PFOA, and another related chemical, PFOS, wrote Ross in his Feb. 15 letter to Schumer. The measure is part of a PFAS Action Plan announced last month by EPA, which can be found online at https://epa.gov/pfas. "We must not allow EPA to kick the can down the road, and delay, delay, and study and delay," said Schumer. In Hoosick Falls, Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics has installed a state-of-the art filtration system and levels of PFOA are now untraceable in water tests. Even so, many Hoosick Falls residents favor a completely new source of water that has never been polluted. PFOA has been linked to kidney and testicular cancer, as well as thyroid diseases and other serious health problems Accompanying Schumer at the UAlbany event, Hoosick Falls Mayor Rob Allen urged quicker action by EPA. "Enough with the delays, enough with the action plans that contain no action," said Allen. A man-made chemical, PFOA has been used since the 1940s to make industrial and household products such as nonstick coatings, stain repellent and heat-resistant wiring. A related chemical that was used in firefighting foam has polluted military bases around the U.S., including Newburgh in New York state. New York has set a standard for PFOA exposure in drinking water at 10 parts per trillion, which is roughly 10 sand grains in an Olympic swimming pool. Currently, EPA has a non-binding PFOA advisory set at 70 parts per trillion.

 An expert witness for Doyle, Mahan testified Wednesday afternoon that samples taken from the leachate outbreak flowing downhill from the landfill showed elevated levels of iron, copper, lead, zinc and benzene. On the Doyle property, he found lead, barium and chromium. Members of the court took a short field trip to the landfill on Tuesday to observe the leachate. The small muddy streambed, while strewn with debris, did not have the orange tint some had testified to seeing. But that doesn't mean it's not polluted or that it is not contaminating Doyle's property, the plaintiff insists. In a combined suit, Doyle, 42, is suing the town, realtors E.J. Murphy, and the Webster family, including brothers Timothy and Hugh and their uncle, Arthur. Doyle brought the suit against the Websters and the realtor for non-disclosure of polluted soil on his South Plains Road property that he bought from the Webster family in 1996. He is suing the Town of Litchfield claiming the landfill is the source of the pollution. On Tuesday, "We observed a leachate outbreak known to contain the same constituents found on Doyle's property," Mahan told the court Wednesday afternoon. Those constituents got there by flowing downhill from the landfill by way of the muddy stream on the south side of Little Pitch Road, he said. A portion of the water continues along the same vein, dumping into a wetlands area. The rest travels through a culvert under Little Pitch Road to a bedrock aquifer, which slopes down to the Doyle property. The surface water now becomes ground water, he said, and through fissures in the bedrock, the water dumps into a small pond behind the Doyle house through two natural springs. Based on his test results culled from samples taken two years ago, Mahan could not say that the Doyle property was a health hazard. But he maintained that it is an environmental health hazard based on evidence recently found and excluded from the trial. On the eve of the trial, Mahan was prepared to testify that in April he found MTBE - methyl butyl tertiary ether - on the Doyle property. A leading oxygenate and octane booster, MTBE is a gas additive that was recently banned by the Environmental Protection Agency because it posses a risk to public health and the environment. Because disclosure to the defense was not made in a timely manner, Superior Court Judge Stephen Frazzini did not allow testimony on this recent findings. The trial will continue on May 23.

 Caption Close The newest test of soil underneath the William Street ball field next to According to a report released Tuesday, the most recent sample taken from the field contained about 500 milligrams of arsenic per kilogram of soil in a section less than 1 foot from the surface. Arsenic levels that total more than 300 milligrams need to be remediated and reported to the state The concentration is high enough to meet the federal Environmental Protection Agency’s definition of a “serious environmental hazard.” The arsenic probably does not endanger the health of neighbors or students at New Lebanon because it is protected by turf and in a fenced-off area, said “I wouldn’t say there are any exposures to the arsenic,” Long said. “The turf is a good barrier to prevent any dispersal of the soil.” Environmental consultants found the elevated sample as they continued testing the soil of prospective sites for a new building for the overcrowded New Lebanon. School and municipal officials want to avoid a repeat of the disruption that marred construction of the new auditorium at Many New Lebanon parents favor a plan, known as Scheme B, to build on the ball field. Arsenic was found under the field last year, which prompted new tests this spring. The follow-up tests showed arsenic in the ground less than 1 foot from the surface at levels above state criteria for “direct residential exposure.” The discovery moved school and municipal officials to cordon off the area, so the contaminated soil would not become exposed. The 500 milligram sample showed up during an ongoing study of the field borings taken in late April. School officials ordered the latest round of tests of soil within the fenced area as they try to specify the extent of arsenic contamination. Recent tests also revealed arsenic and pesticides in a ravine next to the field and the current New Lebanon campus, a possible building site known as Scheme C. The highest arsenic sample in the ravine measured 18 milligrams. The greatest arsenic concentration under the field, other than the 500 milligram sample, totaled 214 milligrams, according to No arsenic or other toxins have been found on New Lebanon’s current campus on Mead Avenue, the site of a Scheme D building proposal. A full report on the latest ball field arsenic tests is expected within the next few weeks, Matten said. When the report arrives, school and municipal officials and consultants will then start developing a clean-up plan. “Whether we build on the field or not, we’re required to remediate that ... arsenic,” Matten said.

Winter rains and runoff create seasonal ponds throughout the flatlands east of Knightsen's town center in far eastern Contra Costa County. But this year's drenching has kept hundreds of acres east of the town's center under one foot to three feet of water since the beginning of February.

 DARIEN — Police are investigating raw sewage illegally dumped behind a mausoleum at Around May 20, a visitor at the cemetery smelled a strong, foul odor coming from behind a mausoleum near the river that runs along the west side of the property. The cemetery manager found someone had dumped a large amount of raw sewage on the river bank sometime during the week before. On May 23, officers went to inspect the scene at the Camp Avenue land. They found truck tire marks 15 feet from the sewage, meaning a septic tank had likely been hauled there and a hose had been used to dispel the sewage.

 A 1,500-gallon sewage spill in Billings Township Thursday morning resulted in some of the waste entering Wixom Lake. “A private contractor was cleaning out the pump chambers of liquids and solids,” said Doug Fitzgerald, Central Michigan Environmental Health supervisor for Gladwin and Clare counties. “They decant, or separate, the water and put it back in for treatment and the solids go to a landfill.” But, the sewage escaped from the back of the truck and spilled into the Billings Township Hall parking lot and entered Wixom Lake. “The spot is in kind of a little bay with stagnant water and algae,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s not an area where swimmers would be planning to use. If it had to happen it couldn’t have happened in a safer place.” While testing for E.coli (Escherichia coli) levels in the lake, Fitzgerald took three samples of water: upstream and downstream from the spill along with at the site of the spill. “Both samples, upstream and downstream, showed no impact from the sewage,” Fitzgerald said. “But, right at the spill, E.coli levels were very high.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that “E. coli bacteria normally live in the intestines of people and animals. Most E. coli are harmless and actually are an important part of a healthy human intestinal tract. However, some E. coli are pathogenic, meaning they can cause illness, either diarrhea or illness outside of the intestinal tract. The types of E. coli that can cause diarrhea can be transmitted through contaminated water or food, or through contact with animals or persons.” Cleanup began by bringing in a vacuum truck to soak up any of the visible sewage spill. “They spread lime on the affected areas, which kills pathogenic bacteria,” Fitzgerald said. “Then they removed several truckloads of water and sucked the water back through to sanitize it.”

 Associated Press Writer LOGAN, W.Va. (AP) _ About 100,000 gallons of coal slurry gushed into two streams after a waste pipe burst at a coal preparation plant, killing fish and raising concerns about the water supply. State regulators ordered Bandmill Coal Co., a subsidiary of Massey Energy Co., to shut down the plant until the spill is cleaned up. After Tuesday's spill, dead minnows were reported in the Guyandotte River and Rum Creek, and investigators were trying to gauge the extent of environmental damage. "It's too messy right now to tell how bad a fish kill is in that area," said Division of Natural Resources spokesman Hoy Murphy. Officials at municipal water treatment plants downstream of the preparation plant kept a wary eye on the slow-moving 6-mile-long spill. Logan's water treatment plant remained open Wednesday, but officials were continuing to monitor water quality. "If the system can't handle it, we'll have to shut it down," said Elbert Smith, a worker at the plant. Coal slurry is a mixture of water, fine coal particles and other waste from washing coal to prepare it for market. Bandmill faces up to $10,000 a day in fines for water quality violations and up to $5,000 a day in administrative penalties, the Department of Environmental Protection said. Massey said its investigators determined that a mistakenly opened valve allowed slurry to enter a smaller water line, raising pressure inside the pipe and causing it to burst. But state investigators said they believe a defect caused the pipe to rupture. "Massey Energy regrets that the leak occurred. We have been working to ensure our operations operate in an environmentally sound manner," said company spokesman Jeff Gillenwater. Massey is West Virginia's largest coal producer and the nation's seventh largest. Another Massey subsidiary, Martin County Coal, was blamed for the largest coal slurry spill ever, 300 million gallons that broke through the bottom of an impoundment near Inez, Ky., on Oct. 11, 2000, gushing into two creeks and the Big Sandy River. On July 19, a sediment pond overflowed at a Bandmill valley fill in West Virginia, damaging or destroying 10 homes along Winding Shoals Hollow. Also in July, the state ordered Massey to close a Mingo County mine after 20,000 gallons of polluted mine water was discharged into a nearby creek and lake. Rum Creek resident Willis Marcum said he is suspicious of Massey's recent environmental mishaps. "It doesn't make sense," he said. "It's like getting struck by lightning 10 times."

 The company, Roy F. Weston Inc. of Michigan, confirmed what members of the Pine River Community Action Group have suspected for the past four years – that the two-foot wall of compacted blue clay surrounding the 54-acre former chemical manufacturing site has been breached, allowing chemicals such as benzene, selenium, vinyl chloride, chromium, mercury and DDT to leak into the river. The breaches are complicating the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, which declared the river a Superfund cleanup site three years ago due to high levels of DDT in soil sediments and fish associated with the river. Stephanie Ball, EPA project manager, told CAG members Wednesday night that work on the river cleanup project would begin again in a month. Work ended late last fall when a 10-foot stretch of cofferdam pounded into the sediment of the river collapsed, allowing the river to fill the cell being excavated. While dewatering of the cell won't begin until May, testing and sampling can begin in April, Ball said. What Ball called a French Drain Collection System will have to be built inside the dewatered river area so that the cleaned areas are not recontaminated with the polluted seeps from the plant site. Ball's workers kicked off intense interest in finding leaks from the site this past summer, when excavation discovered seeps after the river was dewatered next to the plant site. Brian J. O'Mara, principal project manager for Weston, said evidence of the seeps from the plant site were plentiful. The company completed a series of surveys and samplings to determine the extent of the leakage. O'Mara said evidence of non-aqueous phase liquids were plentiful as were petroleum, solvent and chlorobenzene odors in the samples taken at locations surrounding the plant site. And, he said, an engineering design snafu that has resulted in having higher water levels inside the plant site than the river speeds the leakage. "I've never seen another site like this," he said. The preliminary results are not surprising, said Scott Cornelius, Superfund project manager for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, which along with the EPA is pushing the plant site work. "There's the one large area where the wall is not tied into the hardpan and there are a lot of small fractures," Cornelius said. "There would have to be about 1,500 square feet of leaking area to account for the amount of water that can't be accounted for." Cornelius cited a 1997 study that said the site was losing about 11 million gallons of water per year, but it was assumed then the water was leaking from underneath the wall. Weston's preliminary report is Phase 1 of the project. Phase 2 will determine what can be done to fix the wall. That report is expected this summer. Representatives for NWI Land Management, which owns and manages the site, could not be reached for comment by deadline. Ralph E. Wirtz can be reached at (989) 839-4241.

 For decades, a 9,000-pound cannon from a war between Japan and Russia was the landmark motorists noticed at the corner of East Marginal Way and Ellis Avenue -- if they noticed anything about Sternoff Metals at all. The old Hat 'N' Boots gas station just up the road got more attention. But And from that perspective, Hopkins could usually count on seeing a worker processing electrical transformers. The process involved pouring out the oil inside -- almost certainly containing highly toxic PCBs -- directly onto the ground. "I saw hundreds of gallons poured out," said Hopkins, 72, of Des Moines. "It was month after month after month after month." Usually there were between 10 and 100 transformers waiting to be pulled apart. All this took place about 150 yards from a spot on the Duwamish River where authorities today are scrambling to trace a mysterious source of PCBs contaminating Slip 4, a small bay off the Duwamish. That spot on the waterway has some of the highest concentrations of PCBs anywhere on the Duwamish, as well as other pollutants. This "hot spot" was supposed to be cleaned up by now. Instead, authorities have spent years trying to track the source of the mysterious PCBs. They've carefully scrutinized Boeing Field, the city's old Georgetown Steam Plant and substation, drainage lines coming from Interstate 5, and anything else they could think of. They cleaned out drainage lines. The Boeing Co. even had more than 88,000 linear feet of caulk containing about 8 percent PCBs laboriously stripped from the tarmac. At the Tully's plant nearby, it turned out, PCBs were in the paint -- probably from the era when it was the Rainier Beer factory. The old paint was either chipped away or painted over, the state Sternoff Metals' operation on East Marginal closed in 1985. But the family had opened a yard earlier in Renton that was soon in trouble for violations including PCBs coming out of a massive mound of shredded car parts. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Rick+Sternoff%22">Rick Sternoff</a> Sternoff's father and uncles, who ran the property through the 1960s, are dead now, he said, and he doesn't know whether contaminated oil might have been poured out before he arrived. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Robert+Goodstein%22">Robert Goodstein</a> Records show the firm in 1999 hauled away more than 50,000 pounds of soil to a hazardous-waste landfill.

 Associated Press Writer CAION, Spain (AP) _ Winds reaching 60 mph and high waves hindered shoreline cleanup and seafood farmers scrambled to salvage the cockle, mussel and clam harvest Wednesday, a day after the tanker Prestige and its cargo of fuel oil sank off Spain. Yet the high winds, which pushed waves to 26 feet, helped break up a large oil slick off Portugal as Spanish authorities worried the storm was shoving a second fuel oil slick closer to the coast. Seeking to ease fears of an Exxon Valdez-style catastrophe, Spain's Interior Ministry said no fuel had spilled since the single-hulled vessel broke apart and sank about 150 miles off the Spanish coast Tuesday, six days after it ruptured in a storm. Officials said they hoped the oil would solidify two miles down in frigid water, limiting damage in the short-term. The Prestige has spilled about 1.6 million of its 20-million gallon load of heavy fuel oil, a total twice the size of the Exxon Valdez crude-oil spill off Alaska in 1989. Spain said Wednesday it had spotted four oil slicks, including one 10 miles long and 3 miles wide, near the wreckage about 150 miles off the Galician coast. Two smaller slicks are about 40 miles west of Cape Finisterre, and a third is just off the coast at the Muros inlet, Spanish officials said. Portugal said a large slick it was monitoring Tuesday apparently dispersed in rough seas. Spanish Environment Minister Jaume Matas said oil has contaminated nearly 180 miles of Galicia's scenic coastline and rich fishing waters. During a visit to a soiled beach near the fishing port of Caion, he estimated economic losses at $42 million so far, and said the cleanup could take six months. "We have to wait and be prudent because we still don't know whether we have passed the threshold of this crisis," Matas said. Crews with shovels and buckets worked in strong wind and heavy rain to scoop up sludge along Galicia's craggy coast. The government said more than 250 tons of fuel oil had been recovered so far, half on land and half at sea by skimmer boats. Rough seas kept two of the vessels _ sent from France and Holland _ out of the mission Wednesday, the interior ministry said. In some coastal areas not yet hit by the fuel oil, seafood farmers rushed to harvest mussels, clams and cockles ahead of schedule. Spain's fishing industry is worth $330 million a year. In the inlet of Ria de Arosa, described as one of the world's top mussel grounds, harvesters pulled up ropes on which clusters of black mussels grow, and plucked them all. Normally smaller ones are left behind to mature. "The accident has hit us very hard," said Francisco Gomez, a 41-year-old fisherman in the village of Cosme. "The consequences are going to last a long time, at least two years." Luis Ferreira, 42, was pessimistic and recalled that the people of Galicia have a long history of emigration, often to Latin America. "If the situation does not change we will have to pack our bags, just like our ancestors did." He accused the government of understating the amount of oil in the water and said officials don't know the sea. "They only go there on vacation," he said. The same area of northwest Spain suffered a disastrous spill 10 years ago when the Greek tanker Aegean Sea ran aground near A Coruna and lost 21.5 million gallons of oil. In 1999, an oil spill from the tanker Erika polluted 250 miles of French coastline. A U.N. treaty banning single-hulled tankers entered into force this year, but the phase-in period stretches to 2015. European Union officials say their efforts to impose stricter inspections are being subverted by shipowners who avoid EU harbors or avoid dropping anchor when they refuel or pick up supplies. French President Jacques Chirac said Wednesday he would raise the issue of maritime security at next month's EU summit and criticized European officials for not taking a tougher stand against "garbage ships."

 Associated Press Writer SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain (AP) _ Spain and Portugal raced to protect beaches and rich fishing grounds Wednesday from an expected onslaught of fuel oil from a tanker that broke in half and sank off their coasts. The Bahamas-flagged Prestige ruptured in stormy weather Nov. 13, initially spilling about 800,000 gallons of fuel oil that contaminated fisheries, blackened beaches and killed wildlife along a 125-mile stretch of the Iberian peninsula. Despite efforts to salvage the vessel, it split in two and sank Tuesday about 150 miles off Spain's northern coast, near Portugal. Salvagers said it dumped another 800,000 gallons of fuel into the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday. The latest spill, believed to be the ship's own fuel rather than its cargo, was estimated to be 22 miles long and one-third of a mile wide. On Wednesday, cleanup crews were scooping sludge from dozens of Spanish beaches amid hopes that the tanker's remaining cargo _ nearly twice the 10.92 million gallons dumped from the Exxon Valdez near Alaska in 1989 _ would solidify and stay inside the submerged vessel in waters more than two miles deep. "We hope that the sunken part does not spill its fuel. But still it's a time bomb at the bottom of the sea," said Maria Jose Caballero, who heads Greenpeace's coastal protection project in Spain. "There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil." There was no indication Wednesday that the sunken wreckage was leaking, Arsenio Fernandez de Mesa, chief government representative in the Galicia region, told The Associated Press. "There have been no new oil spills since the boat went down," he said. Experts have said there is a chance the oil still inside the sunken Prestige might solidify in the Atlantic's deep, frigid water, limiting short-term environmental damage. While still far offshore Wednesday, winds and ocean currents were projected to carry it east toward land. Maritime authorities and environmentalists in Spain placed floating barriers outside rivers to protect coastal fishing grounds and shellfish beds. European neighbors were expected to send boats equipped to scoop up oil at sea. Portugal's environment minister, Isaltino Morais, said containment efforts would focus on the coast because high winds and waves will probably make it impossible to scoop up much oil at sea. "The battle will be on land," Morais told state radio Antena 1, adding that the Portuguese military was monitoring one of the slicks. In Madrid, Spain's Environment Minister Jaume Matas said, "We have to wait and be prudent because we still don't know whether we have passed the threshold of this crisis." Spain's Development Ministry said it had notified the ship's insurer, London Steamship, that a case was being filed against the company, the ship, its owner and its captain. The government demanded a deposit of $60 million from the company as a guarantee against possible future fines or compensation claims. The ministry said the government had also presented its case to the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund in London. The tanker's Greek captain, Apostolus Maguras, was jailed in Spain on charges of disobeying authorities and harming the environment. Bail was set at $3 million. European countries called for tighter controls on shipping of hazardous cargo after the accident. French President Jacques Chirac referred to the Prestige as a "garbage ship" whose flag of convenience, the Bahamas, and registry, Liberia, seemed aimed at evading European Union safety norms. The ship's management company, Universe Maritime Ltd., is Greek. In its final moments Tuesday, the front and rear tips of the Prestige upended ominously. The bow was the last to sink, shortly after 4 p.m. No one was injured, as the crew had been evacuated earlier. The Prestige was loaded with 20.5 million gallons of fuel oil for its voyage from the Baltic Sea to Singapore. Portugal and Spain barred the ship from their ports. A Universe Maritime official had complained that the crippled vessel was exposed to further damage in storms far from shore. The ship had no history of major safety problems and had been inspected as recently as last month in St. Petersburg, Russia, according to the American Bureau of Shipping, a Houston-based firm that validates a ship's structural and mechanical fitness. European Union Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio sent a letter to the 15 EU capitals on Tuesday urging that new, stiffer inspection rules measures be written into national law and implemented as quickly as possible. Under the new rules, authorities are required to check at least 25 percent of all ships coming into port, starting with older, single-hull vessels. Ships registered in countries with lax safety, labor or tax rules are to be given priority. The incident was the second tanker accident off Europe's Atlantic coasts in three years. In 1999, a spill of the tanker Erika polluted 250 miles of French coastline. The same area of Spain suffered a disastrous spill 10 years ago when the Greek tanker Aegean Sea ran aground near A Coruna and lost 21.5 million gallons. That coastline is known as the "coast of death" because of its jagged geography and list of shipwrecks over the decades.

PCE can damage the kidney and liver and may cause cancer, and TCE is a probable carcinogen. The former Loudon Dry Cleaners and Kem Cleaners operated at the property from 1954 to 1997. Kem Cleaners converted to "drop-off" service only in 1997, according to DEC. The site was added to the state Superfund pollution cleanup program in 2011. Several years ago, high levels of PCE and TCE were found in the groundwater on the 3.9-acre site and were detected leaking from the soil, both outdoors and indoors. Sky Four LLC, owner of the property, discovered the pollution while performing a site assessment for a property transaction, according to DEC. Exposure to PCE likely increases cancer risk, according to the Vapor tests from soil in six locations at the strip mall and two off-site properties found high levels of PCE and TCE. DEC is proposing to install a system to draw hazardous vapor from the soil, and, if necessary, install a depressurization system under the building's foundation to "prevent vapors from migrating into the southern wing of the on-site building. " Chemicals would be injected into the ground beneath the Memorial Hospital parking lot to break down the pollution plume. Test results for vapor emissions at the nearby Loudon Arms Apartments or the hospital buildings show that "neither mitigation nor further monitoring is warranted," according to the DEC plan. A public hearing on the proposal will be held at 4 p.m. Monday at the Under Superfund, the state will pay the expenses of a cleanup project if the polluter will not or cannot pay for it, or cannot be found.

 John Gurley, a spokesman for Connecticut's Zero Mercury Campaign, urged all fishermen to follow Connecticut's Depart-ment of Environmental Protect-ion recommendations for limiting consumption of any freshwater fish. State officials suggest that women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under age six eat only one serving of freshwater fish per month. The DEP's recommendation is that everyone else limit their consumption of freshwater fish to one serving per week. Gurley said, "there are fish consumption warnings for every freshwater lake, pond, river and stream (in Connecticut) due to the high levels of mercury found in fish." The only exception to the recommended limits would be trout less than 15 inches long, according to Gurley. He said most Connecticut trout less than that length have been recently put into streams and lakes from fisheries and haven't had time to ingest significant levels of mercury. Gurley explained that mercury is concentrated as it moves up the food chain from smaller prey fish to larger predators such as the larger trout. DEP officials will be out at six locations today, including Wharton Brook State Park in Wallingford, Wolfe Park in Monroe, Southford Falls State Park in Oxford, Chatfield Hollow State Park in Killingworth, Black Rock State Park in Watertown, and Stratton Brook State Park in Simsbury, to continue the state's trout stocking program and to answer questions about the state's fishing programs and regulations. A variety of polluters, including coal-fired power plants and municipal trash incinerators, are responsible for mercury contamination of fresh water. Gurley, a member of Clean Water Action, said the amount of mercury in a thermometer is only about one gram, but that's enough to contaminate a 20-acre lake for a year. Experts at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimate that some 60,000 American children are born each year with developmental problems as a result of mercury pollution. New regulations to limit mercury emissions from municipal incinerators in Connecticut went into effect last July. According to Gurley, municipal incinerators, which had been New England's largest source of mercury pollution as a result of burning items such as thermometers, fluorescent light bulbs and switches in appliances and automobiles that contained mercury.

 DURANGO, Colo. (AP) — Colorado regulators have ordered a mobile home park northwest of Durango to shut down a sewage lagoon that is seeping into a nearby creek. The state health department said the contaminated lagoon is leeching iron and coliform into Lightner Creek, a slow-flowing tributary of the Animas River. Health officials said coliform can produce strains of E. coli that cause diarrhea, nausea, fever and vomiting to people that come in contact with the water. "They have been a longtime problem for the division," said Mike Harris, a manager for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's clean water enforcement unit. "And it's just gone on too long." The state health department sent a cease-and-desist order to the park's owner, but Darlene Mann denied ever receiving notification from the state. If Mann fails to comply, the people living in the 40 mobile homes could be forced to move. Some residents of Lightner Creek Mobile Home Park said they were unaware of the regulatory dispute, but they were not shocked by news of the shutdown order, the Durango Herald reported ( "That doesn't surprise me - it stinks over there all the time," Crystal Martinez said. "The owner is never around and never listens to our complaints." The owner said she hired a professional agent to address the issues, but no report or official document has been submitted to the state health department. _ _ _ Information from: Durango Herald,

 Caption Close Oil companies in California must stop injecting wastewater from their operations into potentially drinkable aquifers by Oct. 15, according to a plan by state regulators who allowed it to happen for years. In a proposal submitted to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, regulators promised to painstakingly review wells at risk of contamination, ensuring the injections did not taint aquifers already used for drinking water or irrigation in the drought-plagued Central Valley. The plan — from California’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources — comes in response to revelations that, for decades, the division granted oil companies permits to inject leftover water from their operations into aquifers that the federal government wanted protected. Now, with California heading into a fourth year of drought, that water may be difficult for humans to use. A Chronicle analysis found that the state allowed oil companies to drill 171 wastewater injection wells into aquifers that could have been tapped for crops or people. Of those wells, 140 are still in use, according to the division. Injection into those wells must stop by mid-October unless specifically approved by the EPA, according to the plan. <strong>February deadline</strong> An additional 253 wells breached lower-quality aquifers still considered off-limits by the EPA, from which water could have been used with more extensive treatment. Oil companies must cease using these wells by Feb. 15, 2017, barring an exemption from the EPA. The EPA, which helped uncover the practice in 2011, had given the division until Feb. 6 to submit plans for fixing the problem. The EPA has threatened to seize control of regulating the oil industry’s underground injection wells in California if the state doesn’t do a better job protecting groundwater supplies from contamination. (Although the division’s plan is dated Feb. 6, it was released to the public on Monday.) “Our goal is to make sure the state is up to the job,” said The time frame for reform has already drawn fire from environmentalists. But both state and federal regulators say the oil industry will need time to comply. If the division is forced to shut down some wells to protect drinking water supplies, the oil companies will have time to find other ways to deal with the waste. “This is a problem that we worked ourselves into over 30 years, and it’s not a problem that can be solved in a year,” said the division’s new supervisor, <strong>Problem’s roots</strong> The problem dates to 1983, when the EPA gave the division authority to enforce the federal Safe Drinking Water Act in California’s oil fields. The state’s oil reservoirs typically contain large amounts of briny water mixed with the crude. Companies must separate the oil from the water and get rid of the water, which is usually too laden with minerals and hydrocarbons to be used for drinking and irrigation. In addition, oil-extraction techniques such as hydraulic fracturing use freshwater that becomes tainted in the process and needs disposal. Companies inject much of the leftover water back into oil reservoirs. But some of it is pumped into salty underground aquifers that have no oil. The 1983 agreement listed by name aquifers that the oil industry would be able to use with a simple permit from the division. But in a bizarre snafu, there were two signed versions of the agreement, one of which listed 11 aquifers not found on the other. The division started issuing permits for injection wells drilled into those aquifers, even though they didn’t previously contain oil and weren’t viewed by the EPA as suitable for wastewater disposal. Under the agreement, the EPA has final say on which aquifers the oil industry can and can’t use. The state even authorized oil companies to inject into a handful of aquifers already in use for drinking and irrigation, leading to the emergency closure of eight injection wells last year. Officials have now tested nine nearby drinking wells for contamination and found none. But aquifers tainted with chemicals are difficult and expensive to clean, and state water regulators say they can’t be certain that contamination won’t eventually turn up in those drinking water supplies. <strong>Onus on oil firms</strong> In the future, oil companies will need to build a case for why specific aquifers should be considered suitable for wastewater disposal, according to the division’s proposal. The companies will submit their data to the division and the As for the 11 aquifers compromised by the 1983 bureaucratic mix-up, injections there will be phased out by mid-February 2017, unless the EPA decides to let them continue. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22David+R.+Baker%22">David R.

 <i>Bethpage</i> New York is moving forward with a $585 million plan to clean up a massive plume of underground contamination left from Long Island's heyday as a defense and aerospace manufacturing hub, and it's ready to take polluters to court over the bill. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday that if defense contractor Northrop Grumman and the U.S. Navy don't act swiftly, the state will start construction on its own on a system to contain and treat a nearly 7-square-mile swath of pollution from former manufacturing facilities in Nassau County. "We'll never wait for polluters to clean up their mess when it's most convenient for them," Cuomo said in a statement. "The people of Bethpage deserve immediate action to treat the severe contamination caused by this plume and to stop it from spreading." Messages seeking comment were left with representatives for Northrop Grumman and the Navy. In the past, Grumman has called the state's remediation plan "unnecessary, infeasible, and impractical." The company built warplanes at the Bethpage plant for about six decades, until 1996. It was there that the Apollo Lunar Module used in the moon landings came to life. The Navy had an adjacent, Northrop Grumman-operated facility on the 600-acre site for researching, testing, engineering and assembling military aircraft. The plume, discovered in the 1970s, contains 24 contaminants, according to the state's Department of Environmental Conservation. They include TCE, which has been found to be carcinogenic, and 1,4-dioxane, which is possibly carcinogenic. The contamination area is about 4 miles long and more than 2 miles wide in some places and has polluted 11 public water supply wells while threatening another 16, according to the DEC. The polluted wells are being treated for TCE and related compounds, allowing continued use for drinking water purposes, the DEC said.

 Chitose Suzuki | AP Chitose Suzuki | AP Caption Close Chitose Suzuki | AP Lead poisoning, defined as 5 micrograms per deciliter of blood, is especially harmful to children because it can interfere with the development of their brains and nervous systems. Illinois has one of the highest rates of lead poisoning in the nation. The Illinois Department of Public Health is hoping tips can help others address the problem. Although in other places contaminated water and leeching lead pipes cause high levels of poisoning, in Illinois the main culprit is lead paint in older buildings, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health. “Since 1978, lead paint has been banned, but we have lots of beautiful old homes throughout the state where if there hasn’t been a big renovation or remodeling you may still have deteriorating lead-based paint on the walls and on the window sills,” she said. “So the problem with kids when you’re dealing with chipped paint, they’re touching it and from touching it they might end up touching their mouths, so they might end up ingesting parts of it. “It’s on their toys, and there is more of a chance for people to come in contact with it when it’s on the walls and on the window sills and in different parts of the home,” she added. Children in Illinois are tested at least once for lead levels before their sixth birthday, and if high levels of lead are found, public health experts can visit the home to look for the source of contamination, she said. In the meantime, parents, particularly those living in older homes or areas they know to be contaminated, can take precautionary measures such as removing shoes in the home, removing obvious chipped or flaked paint and regularly washing areas such as floors, countertops and windowsills with soap and water.

 GEORGETOWN, S.C. (AP) -- The rusty stains on In 1998, Carter and her neighbors sued Georgetown Steel, then owned by the company Republican presidential candidate State officials determined the mill was largely to blame for the pollution. As the lawsuit dragged on for years, the steel mill filed for bankruptcy and the plant ultimately settled with the residents. In the end, Bain saw more than $30 million in returns on its steel company investment. Carter got $800. "That wasn't even enough to paint the house," said Carter, who is a Romney supporter this election. As a presidential candidate, Romney has pledged to roll back environmental regulations as a way to spur growth. Under President But the story of Georgetown Steel shows how Romney's company thrived under conditions that largely allowed the emissions to continue for years, leaving locals to clean up the mess after Bain left town. Asked to comment on the Bain legacy in Georgetown, the Romney campaign instead criticized Obama on unemployment and green energy projects. A Bain spokeswoman did not directly address the impact of the plant's emissions but instead said the firm "undertook an ambitious plan" to turn around GS Industries and invested millions of dollars into the company. The Georgetown saga surfaced in the mid-1990s, when South Carolina environmental officials received complaints from a local resident asking why his boat kept turning red-orange. The phenomenon was more than a nuisance, like ash from a fire, as dust aggressively stained not only nearby boats but cars and homes as well. The Georgetown residents' complaints came a few years after Bain Capital purchased the Georgetown mill and its sister plant in Kansas City, Mo., as part of a $24.5 million buyout deal. The parent company was later called GS Industries and became one of the largest producers of wire rods. Bain Capital, a private-equity firm Romney co-founded in 1984, had an impressive track record by then. It would eventually buy dozens of troubled companies and help make them profitable, a skill Romney has trumpeted on the campaign trail as making him more suited to lead the country than Obama. But amid Bain's profitable ownership of GS Industries, the plant's production had created unsightly byproducts. By the late 1990s, the red dust was so was so ubiquitous that those who lived in rustic, two-story homes near Georgetown's waterfront took to calling it "The Stuff" -- a mineral called goethite that's used to make steel. "Everybody talked about the red dust, The Stuff," said "My husband scrubbed the house probably every other week with a pressure hose," Burkhardt said. It was often difficult for guests to eat breakfast on the deck. "We had to work like crazy. And for what? Just to keep the outsides of our houses clean." South Carolina regulators placed monitoring sensors around town and compared air-quality results with similar sites in the state capital, Columbia, and in Alabama. In turn, officials wanted to see improvements at the mill and at times cited the plant during Bain's ownership for environmental violations, records show. They also asked that the mill's emissions "be minimized" and that management review its steel-making process to reduce staining. Indeed, the plant paved its dirt roadways, installed a truck wash and sealed gaps in its buildings to prevent The Stuff from leaking out. The state report, made available to So Georgetown neighbors took the mill to court, with the case growing into a class-action lawsuit covering those who lived within a few miles of the steel mill. At one point, the plaintiffs sought millions of dollars in at least three civil cases, civil filings show. The federal government has declared goethite a hazardous substance for workers exposed to large quantities each day. It's generally not toxic like arsenic and it doesn't cause cancer like benzene, two pollutants that are regulated by the In 1999, just as the mill's lawyers asked a local judge to force the plaintiffs to turn over more documents, Romney announced he was leaving Bain to organize the Salt Lake City Olympics. Romney's federal presidential financial disclosures report that he had no active role in Bain after 1999. Several Romney associates recently told the AP that Romney made no managerial decisions after that date, but they also said he kept his formal CEO position and continued to meet with Bain partners. And an AP analysis of regulatory documents between 1999 and 2001 also showed Romney kept up an active role in overseeing Bain-related investments. Romney stood to benefit financially from his company's investments. And his departure from Bain also came as the balance sheets at GS Industries began to look bleak. Despite Bain's reputation for turning around troubled companies like Staples and Domino's Pizza, the Georgetown plant was in trouble. In February 2001, the company filed for bankruptcy protection with more than $500 million in debt. Romney has blamed cheap steel from China for the plant's demise, telling Fox News in December that he remembered a few dozen steel mills also foundered. But as soon as the bankruptcy documents were filed, company lawyers told the Georgetown neighbors that the settlement was on hold. To see any money, they'd have to get in line behind everyone else -- including Bain, with its majority ownership share. The steel mill offered to settle the case for $870,000. Bain, for its part, reported $33.9 million in total valuation of GS Industries, according to a 2004 prospectus by Deutsche Bank. By September 2003, as GS Industries was emerging from bankruptcy and after Bain sold the company, a local judge ordered that Georgetown homeowners in the lawsuit receive their money. After attorney's fees, that came to about $113,000, split dozens of ways. And it certainly wasn't enough to repair the damage, some residents said. "I had the house cleaned and pressure-washed all the time," said Paul Skoko, who was among those who sued. "Within two years, it needed to be done again. That's when I said, 'That's it. I'm not doing this anymore. It simply costs too much." Skoko opted to let his house turn a hue of burnt orange-red.

 <strong>1996-09-05 04:00:00 PDT AL PROTESTS; TOWNSGE: SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA; MOBILE, ARIZONA</strong > The mud is classified as hazardous waste in California. But the Thursday or Friday, Southern Pacific Railroad is expected to deliver the first 45 gondola cars to a Waste Management Inc.-owned landfill near Mobile, Ariz. The town of about 100, predominantly Latino and African American, lies 30 miles southwest of Phoenix. "This stuff should never be dumped in Mobile," said "Arizona's weak environmental laws aren't protective of public health," Angel said. "Mobile is a poor community of color. This is environmental racism." Arizona accepted the DDT-laced dirt after the original dump site town, Colorado Springs, objected. The contractor, Waste Management, then turned to its backup choice, Mobile. The government banned DDT in 1973 after scientists showed that it interfered with reproduction of birds by thinning egg shells and causing defects in offspring. The For decades, the pesticide lay on the bottom of the Richmond Inner Harbor, discharged by several companies that processed the pesticide between 1947 and 1966. In 1990, the EPA put United Heckathorn Co.'s former 13-acre site in the Lauritzen Channel near Cutting Boulevard on its Superfund list of worst toxic sites, requiring the responsible parties to clean up the DDT. At the time, the agency estimated that nearly 11,000 people lived within a mile of the site. In recent years, health officials posted signs along the piers and shoreline in Richmond warning people who fish against eating their catch. Wildlife officials said DDT was harming birds in the Bay that were protected by the Endangered Species Act, including the brown pelican, peregrine falcon, least tern, California clapper rail and bald eagle. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Montrose+Chemical+Co.%22">Montrose Chemical Co.</a> Since August, the company has been dredging the mud, drying it on a football-field-sized concrete-walled pad near Cutting Boulevard and Interstate 580 and loading it on the 45 rail cars. "All we're doing is getting something the consistency of soup and making it a Play-Doh," said The EPA's project manager for the site, Colorado had approved disposal at a landfill near Colorado Springs, and the EPA approved it, but the county raised land-use issues about using a siding as a transfer station. Waste Management withdrew, then approached its second choice. "Arizona agreed to it," Mullins said. Tuesday, Before the dredging, Waste Management had also obtained approval for a third potential dump site, in the hills near Kettleman City in Kings County, Mullins said. But if the waste were disposed of in California, it would need a higher level of treatment, perhaps even incineration, said The plan in Mobile is to intersperse garbage, which goes to the landfill, with the DDT dirt. Mullins doesn't expect the pesticide to leach into the groundwater, which is a concern of environmentalists. "The disposal site has an engineered lining, a collection for leachate (fluid produced by decaying garbage) and a groundwater-monitoring system," Mullins said. Besides, non-soluble DDT adheres to mud and isn't expected to migrate in water, Mullins said. But environmental and community groups aren't convinced, and some Richmond environmentalists are siding with them. The Rev. Their solution is to scoop up the dredge spoils and store them above ground in monitored containment, away from people and groundwater. "We feel it's really wrong to bring the toxic waste here," said The DDT can move in underground streams that feed the Colorado River, which is used for drinking water, Carrasco said. "We're tired of Aztlan, our traditional homeland, continually being used for toxic dumping," he said. &lt;

 BREMERTON -- After polluting Sinclair Inlet for most of a century, it seemed that the But last month, Navy officials had to admit that the work had spread contaminants over a large portion of the inlet, including state-owned bay bottom where they had been refused permission to dump. The Navy has a proud history here, building and r Much of the PCB contamination poisoning the Sound can be traced to naval operations. The highly toxic chemical has worked its way up the food chain to orcas, damaging their ability to reproduce. Today, leading orca scientist <b> </b> The Navy has admitted that leaving contaminants in place violates the intent of the Superfund cleanup program, which prefers that polluters either neutralize toxic waste or haul it off to special landfills. Navy documents say the service saved more than $62 million on the Manchester and Sinclair Inlet cleanups alone. Additional safeguards, such as security fences and deed restrictions that prevent nearby development, "Environmental stewardship is a top priority," the Navy wrote in response to questions from the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. " Puget Sound Naval Shipyard pursues a standard of environmental excellence which will protect and improve the quality of our environment, prevent pollution, and conserve our natural resources." The Navy's dredging of the Bremerton dry docks was supposed to be a model of military efficiency. Not only would the operation remove pollutants dumped at the docks, it would deepen channels enough to allow huge nuclear-powered aircraft carriers to come in for repairs. The proposal went to the EPA on March 13, 2000. The EPA departed from its normal procedure of requiring a detailed investigation that usually takes years. The agency approved the plan on June 13, 2000, three days before the dredging began. The Navy says its cleanup method had never been used before at a Superfund site. Tainted mud and sand was dug up and barged to where a pit the length of two football fields had been dug in the bottom of the inlet -- a depth of 30 to 40 feet. But the dumping went awry: Contaminants sloshed out of the pit and spread. PCBs were detected more than 600 feet away. "This was something we just did not anticipate," But some Everett residents predicted just that back in the late '80s, when the Navy proposed dredging up contaminants off that city's waterfront. "Imagine yourself atop Seattle's Columbia Tower," wrote In Everett, the Navy wanted to dredge bay bottom contaminated by industrial dumping in order to establish a new home port. After protests, the service decided to dredge uncontaminated sediments instead. On land, the Bremerton shipyard has been polluted by pesticides, PCBs and petroleum at levels high enough to warrant a cleanup under state law, Navy records show. Nevertheless, Navy consultants say there is little chance contaminants will be washed into the inlet, and they will conduct tests to make sure. But the Navy did not even consider digging up the contaminated soils. The EPA does not plan to require it -- which troubles some who worry that the tides will seep in and out of the contaminated ground, leaching out pollutants as if the shipyard were a big, polluted teabag. "If this was my client, I would have to clean up the soil," said environmental cleanup consultant "I just spent the whole day digging out diesel from someone's basement because of (state) regulations, costing a normal average Joe tens of thousands of dollars, and in the meantime the Navy gets away with this?" The Navy's pollution has been a big factor in cutting off most fishing in Sinclair and Dyes "Fisheries to us are very important. . . . We utilize those resources on the beach pretty much on a daily basis," George said. "It wasn't through any fault of ours that our people are now restricted to little postage-stamp areas to harvest." The Navy must be held accountable, said New York attorney "What's the difference between just going out and taking those fish, and saying you can't fish? They basically liquidated that asset for cash," Kennedy said. "It's funny that this is done in the name of national security, because if you had a foreign enemy who was poisoning your food supply, it would be considered an act of war."

WILTON — Remediation is underway following a spill of an estimated 600 to 800 gallons of home heating oil at 166 Nod Hill Road. The spill, which according to the Wilton Health Department occurred around Dec. 20, released a “significant amount” of oil onto the ground, Health Director Barry Bogle said in a letter to residents near the site. The letter was dated Dec. 30. The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection was notified, Bogle said, and is overseeing remediation at the site, which includes determining contamination within a 500-foot radius of the spill site. According to information Bogle said he was given, there had been a delivery of oil and a follow-up delivery to top off the tank. While the oil was being delivered, materials under the newly installed tank gave way with the weight of the oil. That broke the service line that feeds the furnace and released all or most of the oil that was in the tank. Bogle could not say if anyone was home at the time of the delivery, but when someone arrived they smelled oil and called the oil company. According to the Wilton assessor’s online database, 166 Nod Hill Road is a 9.9-acre property. The health department is monitoring the cleanup and Bogle said residential wells within 500 feet will be monitored over the next four weeks. Water samples are being collected and tested for any oil contamination. The sampling is being done by GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc. The company’s project manager has been charged with acting as a liaison with residents. After the four weeks of testing a decision will be made as to further sampling of wells. Should any well test positive, residents at that address will receive bottled water, Bogle said. Further testing on any contaminated wells will be done to determine what remedial steps should be taken. The health department expects to receive a status report each week and information will be forward to residents. The health department may be reached at 203-563-0175.

 St. Louis residents learned Wednesday night their municipal wells are not in danger of pollution from the former Velsicol Chemical Corp., but … They did learn chemicals from the plant site are migrating off-site, and that the shallow aquifer below and to the north of the city and the deep aquifer below that has shown pollution in the topmost layer. The St. Louis Superfund Citizens Task Force heard two different reports concerning the health of the Pine River and the contaminants still flowing out of the 54-acre former chemical plant site that sits on its banks. Rob Cannestra of Weston Solutions, a company hired by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to study the leaks, said preliminary studies show the slurry wall, built to surround the massively polluted plant site, is leaking, and that none of the 20 slurry wall samples collected met the design criteria in the 1982 agreement between Velsicol and the State of Michigan. "The containment is not quite as good as everybody thought," he said. Contaminants are moving off-site to the north and west, Cannestra said, probably through the wall and underneath the wall in sandy and/or silty layers. Those sand layers are porous, and are probably the transportation route for NAPL (non-aqueous phase liquids), a combination of chemicals, often in conjunction with petroleum base, which was found by workers in sandy layers at the bottom of the now-dewatered portion of the river. NAPL is heavier than water and won’t mix with it. Cannestra said preliminary results in the shallow aquifer showed contaminants that have moved off-site include DDT, lindane, benezene, chlorobenzene, chloroform, trichloroethene, napthalene, 2-chlorophenol and mercury. More tests are needed to determine the scope and magnitude of the pollution and a complete report won’t be completed until next summer, Cannestra said. "If there is nothing across the river (on the north side across from the plant site) then we know we got a handle on the magnitude of the problem," he said. Rob Stryker said 54 55-gallon drums of DNAPL (dense non-aqueous phase liquids) have been taken from soils in a natural sand/gravel trench underneath the river in the Hot Spot cell, the first cell that was drained and cleaned in emergency action three years ago. That DNAPL contains 28 percent DDT, or 280,000 parts per million. Stryker is project manager for CH2M Hill, the company hired by the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up contaminants from the river bottom that accumulated during more than 40 years of industrial operation. DNAPL has been found in other cells, too, Stryker said, and it is continuing to pollute the groundwater below the river. In an attempt to help correct the problem, a collection trench has been dug around the slurry wall and lateral trenches have been dug into the river bottom to try to capture the DNAPL. DNAPL will flow into manholes built into the river, be collected and sent to a hazardous waste landfill. The river bottom will be capped in some locations so that the water flowing over the DNAPL-laden soil won’t pick up the contaminants. It is expected that silts will cover the clay cap over time, Stryker said. EPA Project Manager Stephanie Ball said sediment removal on the site has been completed for the year, but the project is going to take longer than initially thought "With the finding of the DNAPL, it is a bigger issue than we thought in prior years. It has changed the focus of our cleanup." More than $32 million has been spent on the cleanup to date, Ball said.

The report says the specific chemicals are known to cause a range of developmental and reproductive disorders. The toxins render many waterways, such as the Connecticut river, unswimmable and unfishable, the report says. The data on the pollutants, according to the report, came directly from the Environmental Protection Agency, which requires polluters to report toxic discharges into the nation ’s waterways.

 Caption Close <i> Bakersfield, Calif.</i> Regulators in California, the country's third-largest oil-producing state, have authorized oil companies to inject production fluids and waste into what are now federally protected aquifers more than 2,500 times, risking contamination of underground water supplies that could be used for drinking water or irrigation, state records show. While the permits go back decades, an Associated Press analysis found that nearly half of those injection wells — 46 percent — were approved or began injections in the last four years under Gov. In California, "we need a big course correction. We need to get the system back in compliance," said The injections are convenient for oil companies because drilling brings up 13 gallons of wastewater for every gallon of petroleum. And one of the easiest disposal methods is simply to send that waste back underground. The federal government is demanding state officials do more to deal with contamination and end oil field injection in all aquifers set aside for families and farms. Those water supplies are especially vital because California, the nation's most populous state and its agricultural leader, is entering the fourth year of a historic drought. Oil industry operations can introduce high levels of salts or other contaminants that can ruin water aquifers for drinking or watering crops and livestock. State officials acknowledge that regulators erred, citing confusion about the boundaries of aquifers and oil fields, long-standing state misinterpretations of federal water-safety requirements and lack of communication between state-level oil and water regulators. The vast majority of the more than 2,500 permits under scrutiny were issued after the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act heightened protection for underground water supplies. For some of the permits, "we don't know how this got approved," said

 Caption Close More than half of the wastewater from fracked oil wells in California is disposed of in open, unlined pits and could contaminate groundwater, according to a The California Council on Science and Technology The study authors, many of them from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, stress that they found no cases in California of groundwater contamination due to fracking or stimulating oil wells with acid. Nor did they find confirmed cases in which disposal of oil-field wastewater underground triggered earthquakes, a phenomenon that has caused a surge of tremors in Oklahoma. But no state agency has systematically searched for water contamination or a link to earthquakes, they write. And fracking can use so many different chemicals — two-thirds of which have unknown effects on the environment — that contamination could slip by undetected. <strong>Contamination question</strong> “We found little evidence of any impacts, of groundwater contamination, and we found few studies that actually looked for that contamination,” said Jane Long, lead researcher on the study’s science team. “The fact that we haven’t looked for it is an issue.” Dumping fracking wastewater into unlined, open-air pits could contaminate aquifers used for drinking and irrigation and should either be closely monitored or stopped altogether, the authors write. More than 900 such pits, many without proper permits from the state, dot the oil fields of the San Joaquin Valley, and some of them lie atop usable aquifers. <strong>Attention to disposal</strong> “This is a source of contamination that needs to be managed,” Long said. “The water needs to be tested and treated, or the pits need to be closed.” The state should also pay special attention to areas where oil companies are fracking shallow wells that lie close to drinking-water supplies. The authors found several places, in both the San Joaquin Valley and the densely populated Los Angeles Basin, where fracking has happened at depths less than 1,000 feet. Fracking uses a high-pressure blend of water, sand and chemicals to crack rocks and release oil or natural gas. Acid stimulation employs powerful acids to open channels within the rocks and can be used on its own or in conjunction with fracking. Environmental groups pushing for a statewide fracking ban seized on some of the report’s details to describe the practice as an ongoing threat to the state’s air, water and residents. “This study exposes California’s oil producers as the polluters that they are,” said Andrew Grinberg, the oil and gas program manager for Clean Water Action. “The science clearly identifies numerous threats from fracking and other oil-production activities that California’s laws, regulations, enforcement and available data do not adequately address.” <strong>Industry’s view</strong> The oil industry, similarly, pointed to the study as further proof that fracking has not caused widespread harm. “The extensive research confirms what regulators and scientists have said previously: There is no evidence of groundwater contamination or induced earthquakes to date in California, after many decades of the routine use of hydraulic fracturing in the state,” said Dave Quast, California director for Energy in Depth, an oil industry public outreach campaign. The study, however, could produce results in Sacramento. Sen. Fran Pavley, D-Agoura Hills (Los Angeles County), said she would amend a pending bill to phase out wastewater disposal pits. Pavley wrote the 2013 law regulating well-stimulation techniques that triggered Thursday’s study. The pits, she said, “pose a risk to the health of animals and humans.” <strong>Minimal water use</strong> The study’s authors emphasize that fracking in California uses far less water than in other states. That’s largely because the wells fracked here tend to be shallower and shorter than in other oil-producing regions and seldom use horizontal drilling. Fracking also requires significantly less water than other oil-production techniques common in California, such as flooding old oil reservoirs with steam. But the council, created in 1988 to advise the Legislature on technical issues, wasn’t authorized to conduct its own water-quality tests. Instead, the group was asked to survey and analyze all the data it could find on fracking in the state. Large gaps in the data remain. For example, the authors found only one small California earthquake in 1991 that had been attributed to fracking. They found no recorded cases in the state of earthquakes being triggered by the underground disposal of wastewater from fracking and other forms of oil drilling. But the possible link between tremors and wastewater disposal wells in California has not been researched in a systematic way, the authors wrote. The study includes a map of disposal wells and earthquake epicenters that shows two areas with concentrations of both, in eastern Ventura County and near Coalinga in the San Joaquin Valley. But further study is needed to tell if one caused the other, Long said. “We do see some situations where injection sites are co-located on the map with earthquakes, but we don’t know if they’re correlated in time or correlated in depth,” she said.

 FARMINGTON, N.M. — A yellow sludge spilling from a shuttered gold mine into a southwestern Colorado river has reached northern New Mexico, a state official said Saturday. The plume arrived in the city of Aztec on Friday night and Farmington on Saturday morning, San Juan County Emergency Management Director Don Cooper said. Officials in both cities shut down the river’s access to water treatment plants and say the communities have a 90-day supply of water and other water sources to draw from. “There’s not a lot we can do. We can keep people away (from the river) and keep testing,” Cooper said. “We still don’t know how bad it is.” About 1 million gallons of wastewater from Colorado’s Gold King Mine began spilling into the Animas River on Wednesday when a cleanup crew supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency accidentally breached a debris dam that had formed inside the mine. The mine has been inactive since 1923. Federal officials say the spill contains heavy metals including lead and arsenic, and tests were being analyzed. The spilled water also contained cadmium, aluminum, copper and calcium, but the concentrations were not immediately known. The Animas flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico, and the San Juan flows into Utah, where it joins the Colorado River in Lake Powell. The EPA warned people to stay out of the river and to keep domestic animals from drinking from it. Local officials declared stretches of the river off-limits in Colorado and New Mexico. At least two of the heavy metals found in the waste water can be lethal for humans with long-term exposure. Arsenic at high levels can cause blindness, paralysis and cancer. Lead poisoning can create muscle and vision problems for adults, harm development in fetuses and lead to kidney disease, developmental problems and sometimes death in children, the EPA said. Water continues to spill from the mine at a rate of about 700 gallons per minute, Joan Card, an adviser to EPA Regional Director Shaun McGrath, said Saturday. Crews were building containment ponds to catch and treat the water. Officials said the contamination would likely settle into sediment in Lake Powell. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area officials said visitors will be warned starting Monday to avoid drinking, swimming or boating on affected stretches of the lake and river until further notice. The spill from the mine flowed down Cement Creek and into the scenic Animas River.

 Caption Close California regulators on Thursday closed 33 oil company wells that had injected wastewater into potentially drinkable aquifers protected by federal law. The new closures bring to 56 the number of oil-field wastewater injection wells shut down by the state after officials realized they were pumping oil-tainted water into aquifers that  potentially could be used for drinking or irrigation. All but two of the latest closures are in Kern County, in California’s drought-stricken Central Valley. One lies in Ventura County, another in northern Los Angeles County. Officials with California’s Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources spent Friday verifying that they had, in fact, closed. Of the 33, only 21 had been actively injecting wastewater before Thursday.   <strong>Fears of contamination</strong> The division, part of California’s Department of Conservation, for years issued oil companies permits to inject their left-over water into aquifers that were supposed to be off-limits, protected by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The problem, So far, however, no drinking water supplies have been found to be tainted by the injections. Still, some environmentalists expressed outrage that so few wells had been closed. The division has identified 178 wells that were injecting into legally protected aquifers with relatively high water quality, defined as those with a maximum of 3,000 parts per million of total dissolved solids. More than 2,000 other wells inject into aquifers that would be harder to use for drinking water, either because they are too salty or because they also contain oil. “This is too little, too late to protect our water,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity. “With each passing day the oil industry is polluting more and more of our precious water.” The division reported Friday, however, that not all 178 wells required closure. Some had already been shut down by their operators, while others had been converted into wells for extracting oil — not dumping wastewater. An oil industry trade group noted that all of the wells closed Thursday had received state permits, even if the state now acknowledges that those permits should never have been issued. “Both regulators and producers are committed to protecting underground water supplies, and today’s announcement reinforces the seriousness of that commitment,” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association. <strong >Safeguarding water supplies</strong> “California’s oil and natural gas producers are committed to operating their wells in a manner that continues to safeguard public water supplies,” she said. Revelations that the division allowed injections into relatively fresh groundwater supplies touched off a political firestorm, triggered lawsuits, and led Bohlen to launch a reorganization of his staff. More well closures will likely follow. Under regulations adopted this year, wells injecting into aquifers with water quality between 3,000 and 10,000 total dissolved solids must cease injections by Feb. 15, 2017, unless granted an exemption from the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

 KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Veronica Tate knew from the stench that sewage was among the 8 feet of water that swamped the basement of her ranch-style home after the nearby Meramec River overflowed. The larger concern for residents of her suburban St. Louis neighborhood is the unknown of what else the noxious blend might have contained. “It came up through the sewers, I guess,” Tate, a customer service representative for an insurance company, said of last week’s flooding. “When you get down there and look at it, there’s a smell. There’s an odor.” Wastewater was a certainty in her Arnold neighborhood, given that two nearby treatment plants failed when the Meramec flooded in record fashion after days of unrelenting rain. The inundation has spewed tens of millions of gallons of untreated human waste, according to the sewer district’s website, on a path toward the Mississippi River and an unavoidable southward trek to the Gulf of Mexico. Those plants remained offline Tuesday. But the floodwaters also could include such things as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides washed away from farmland, not to mention livestock waste, industrial chemicals, dead animals, fuel from convenience stores and toxins from railroad tracks. Even pollutants from things as small as the gas can in a flooded garage. “You certainly don’t want to expose bare skin to an unknown cocktail of chemicals,” said Chris Whitley, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokesman in Lenexa, Kansas. “We recognize it’s a balancing act between the desire to have things normal again versus sitting around waiting for the water to go down or other things to happen to clean up your property. The (health) consequences posed by these other hazards can be much longer lasting.” Much of the pollution eases its way into the Meramec and other rivers that feed into the Mississippi, for many communities the source of drinking water. By Tuesday, the inundation from last week’s flooding had been cleared from Tate’s home in Arnold, and the 55-year-old woman’s basement will soon be gutted to contain another health concern — dangerous mold that can infest soaked sheet rock, flooring and furniture. There’s not yet an official tally of homes and businesses in the area that sustained damage. Even soggy sandbags, touted as last-ditch defenders against floodwaters, can’t be kept for reuse because the inundations turn them into mountains of smelly, polluted sacks ultimately destined for landfills, along with flood-ruined household wares like sodden flooring, furniture and appliances. Well over a million sandbags were put to use in Missouri and Illinois since Christmas Day, according to governmental figures. With each bout of broad flooding, such pollution threatens to sicken anyone who wades into the water, prompting health officials to urge affected residents — and even reporters — to proactively keep current on tetanus shots if they’re unable to stay away from direct contact with the floodwaters. Floodwaters may contain more than 100 types of disease-causing bacteria, according to a 2012 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists. And while the frequency of waterborne illnesses due to flooding is not immediately clear, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that direct contact to inundations and the fecal bacteria they may contain could cause gastrointestinal illness or other infections. “The best way to avoid problems is to stay out of the water completely unless you have to be,” Whitley said. “Let the water go down, then do your recovery. It’s safer all around.” In Chester, Illinois, 60 miles southeast of St. Louis, the Mississippi rolling by is the 8,600-resident city’s sole supplier of drinking water, Chester water plant supervisor Tim Crow said Tuesday. During inundations that could impact Chester, Crow said he relies on guidance from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. But Crow insists the city’s water supply remains safe and exceeds state environmental standards, noting that sewage in the engorged Mississippi “is so diluted when it gets to us.” “We monitor it, but at this time there’s no level of concern,” he said at the water plant, which treats roughly 1.5 million gallons of water a day during the winter. The rains that caused this winter’s flood, blamed already for at least 25 deaths in Missouri and Illinois and damage to hundreds of homes and businesses, ended a week ago. But the water continued rising Tuesday in southern Missouri and Illinois. Several other states along the Mississippi still were bracing for the crest.

 QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's state oil company says it has resumed pumping through the country's main pipeline four days after it was damaged by a landslide. But a spill caused by the slide polluted drinking water for a city of about 80,000 people. Petroecuador issued a statement Tuesday saying pumping resumed at 9:15 a.m. (1415 GMT). A Friday landslide damaged the trans-Ecuador pipeline, causing the spill of some 420,000 gallons (1.6 million liters) of crude oil. Some entered the Coca river, a tributary of the Amazon that also flows through Peru and Brazil. Environmental activist Alexandra Almeida says the spill left the regional capital city of Coca without drinking water. The oil company is distributing bottled water to residents. Ecuador has warned Brazil and Peru of possible river pollution because of the spill.

 <i>Albany</i> The world's largest oil company is paying the state more than $8 million to cover disputed costs of a state-run cleanup of a former oil terminal on the St. Lawrence River, according to state Attorney General The payment from Since 2006, the state spill fund has spent about $9.3 million for cleanup at Lighthouse Point on the St. Lawrence and Oswegatchie rivers in Ogdensburg, where a petroleum terminal owned by ExxonMobil and its corporate ancestors operated for about a century before closing in 1984. Pollution was found there in 2001, and a state cleanup began several years later. ExxonMobil initially believed it settled the cleanup bill for $6 million in 2006 with former Comptroller "Through today's agreement, we're not only returning millions to the state but also holding ExxonMobil responsible for their role in this oil spill," the attorney general said. The remaining balance of the cleanup, more than $1 million, will be borne by the spill fund. "We are pleased to have reached a settlement with the State of New York," said ExxonMobil spokesman For 2012-13, the fund spent about $14.8 million statewide on cleanups, and recovered about $8.2 million in reimbursement and penalties from polluters, ending the year with a $3 million deficit, according to state records. The fund began 416 cleanups statewide during that time, and completed 111. Since the fund began in 1978, it has spent more than $464 million on spill cleanups, $306 million to run the program, and collected $196 million from polluters. During that same period, the gasoline tax kicked in $577 million. < i><a href="mailto:bnearing@timesunion.com">bnearing@timesunion.com</a></i>

 Caption Close <i>Aliceville, Ala.</i> Environmental regulators promised an aggressive cleanup after a tanker train hauling 2.9 million gallons of crude oil derailed and burned in a west Alabama swamp in early November amid a string of North American oil train crashes. So why is dark, smelly crude oil still oozing into the water four months later? The isolated wetland smelled like a garage when a reporter from An environmental group now says it has found ominous traces of oil moving downstream along an unnamed tributary toward a big creek and the Tombigbee River, less than 3 miles away. And the mayor of a North Dakota town where a similar crash occurred in December fears ongoing oil pollution problems in his community, too. As the nation considers new means of transporting fuel over long distances, critics of crude oil trains have cited the Alabama derailment as an example of what can go wrong when tanker cars carrying millions of gallons of so-called Bakken crude leave the tracks. Questions about the effectiveness of the Alabama cleanup come as the Environmentalist "I believe they really thought that because it's out of sight, out of mind, out in the middle of a swamp, that nobody was going to pay attention," said Wathen. Regulators and the company deny any such thing occurred, however. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Alabama Yet four months later, officials still say no one knows exactly how much oil was spilled. That's mainly because an unknown amount of oil burned in a series of explosions and a huge fire that lasted for hours after the crash. Since no one knows how much oil burned, officials also can't say how much oil may be in the swamp.

 Caption Close STAMFORD -- Residents living around the Heavy rainfall sent an unprecedented amount of wastewater rushing through Stamford's sewage treatment plant Wednesday night, overwhelming the facility's disinfection system and spilling 25 million gallons of partially treated sewage into the harbor. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Erika+Lelievre%22">Erika Lelievre</a> "It is disgusting. It was in all the slips and channel," said Lelievre, who has lived at the marina for eight years. "It has happened before, but this was the worst," The skies had cleared by midday Thursday, but Stamford waters remained coated in a foamy, light brown film. Mayor "We're very concerned about any exposure to water that has a very high bacteria count," Fountain said. The sewage will eventually be cleaned out of the canal through natural tidal flushing, state environmental officials said. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Stamford+Yacht+Club%22">Stamford Yacht Club</a> "It's a darn shame, and I know that that amount of rainfall causes all kinds of havoc, but to be ready to go and have something like that happen, forcing a cancellation is kind of a bummer," Ryan said. "We're hoping the next few tide cycles will clean things up for us. By tomorrow and Saturday, provided there's no more discharge, we're going to be racing." The regatta is held on the open waters of Long Island Sound and will not take place in the contaminated waters, though the location of the Yacht Club means officials will have to find safe ways for the participants to reach that open water when the races continue. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex =solr&amp;query=%22Water+Pollution+Control+Authority%22">Water Pollution Control Authority</a> Carl Bochterle, a dock master at Harbor House Marina on the East Branch, said he saw a high volume of sewage running down the channel. A large amount of sludge stuck to the docks where some people live full time on their boats. "It stinks. It is disgusting," he said. "This is not acceptable. If a boat owner had a fuel spill causing only a fraction of the problems this spill caused, they would be held responsible and fined. Why are they not made to clean this up when they decide to discharge it down the channel?" Lelievre said most people don't see what happens on the water. If something like Wednesday's sewage spill happened anywhere on land, "there would be a huge outcry," she said. "I was watching the cormorants this morning dive for food and come out of the brown muck," she said. "So they are eating, living and breathing in it out here. Something needs to be done with the sewage being released out here." The WPCA has been plagued by sewage spills in recent years, many of which were caused by equipment malfunctions at its facility. Wednesday's spill was not the result of an infrastructure failure, however, but rather by heavy, high-intensity rainfall. According to the Stamford has separate lines for its storm water and sewage. Rainwater enters underground piping through storm drains and flows directly into Long Island Sound, while sewage is flushed out of homes and businesses through a separate line, which carries the wastewater to the WPCA for treatment. During significant rainstorms, however, underground pressure from heavy rainfall can cause water to seep into the sewer lines through cracks in its joints or piping. This increases the flow of wastewater into the WPCA, straining its disinfection system. Stamford's wastewater treatment plant typically treats about 18 million gallons of sewage on an average day, and 24 million gallons on rainy days, Brink said. The facility's ultimate capacity is 58 million gallons of sewage per day, but flow levels briefly topped a record-high 73 million gallons at the height of Wednesday's rainstorm. "It's not just how many inches of rain that comes down, it's how fast it comes down," Brink said. The heavy flow made it impossible for the WPCA to completely treat all of the wastewater that flowed through its system late Wednesday night, causing the sewage spill visible in Stamford waters Thursday. Some sewage also spilled out of a manhole on Weed Avenue, city officials said. "This flow exceeded anything we've seen at the plant previously," Martin said. "We're going to do a review on why there's so much extra water in the system." The review would likely be an infiltration flow study, Brink said. WPCA officials or a private contractor would send a video camera through the city's sewer lines to identify areas where cracks are allowing water to enter the pipes. "It's very difficult to find all the sources of infiltration," he said. Brink said he did not know much the study would cost, but said it would likely be expensive since Stamford has more than 100 miles of underground sewer lines. The last big sewage spill to foul the harbor occurred in October 2012. Residents and boat owners noticed a foul stench in the water and found floating blobs of much thicker sewage all over the water, with much of it fouling boats and docks at Czescik Marina. WPCA officials sampled the sewage and said it was decomposed and appeared to be several days old. They concluded it likely ended up in the water after being illegally dumped into a nearby storm drain by a private sewage disposal company. Police reviewed surveillance videos from buildings around the harbor and the city's operations department checked storm sewers in the area for discharges, but no one was apprehended in the matter. In early 2012, The Advocate reviewed records provided by the Department of Aquaculture and found the WPCA bypassed partially treated or raw sewage into Stamford Harbor or Long Island Sound 26 times between March 2010 and October 2012. Some bypasses were small and contained as little as 10 gallons of raw sewage. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Marc+Cohen%22">Marc Cohen</a> "They go after us to use our holding tanks and can't flush out heads into the Sound.

 A proponent and a critic of the proposed Ike Dike recently said the same thing. They said the oil spill near the Texas City Dike ought to be a wake-up call. The spill, which resulted in a collision between a barge and a cargo ship, was relatively minor. But it still shut down the Houston Ship Channel for days, with repercussions to the nation’s supply of fuels and petrochemicals. If that was a minor problem, what would a real disaster look like? What would happen if a hurricane toppled the tanks that store the really toxic stuff at plants along the bay? How long would major ports, refineries and plants be shut down? Months? A year? How long would it take to clean up? Would the bay ever recover? Such concerns led to the proposed Centennial Gate, a storm barrier near the Hartman Bridge at La Porte and Baytown. That project was relatively inexpensive and could be built quickly. It would protect an area where those large tanks, refineries and plants are concentrated. The project would offer some assurance that those facilities wouldn’t pollute the whole bay if a hurricane struck. However, five communities, worried the proposed protection of the upper ship channel would flood them, passed resolutions against the Centennial Gate. Other communities along Galveston Bay complained that the Centennial Gate concept would do nothing for them. Eighteen local governments have passed resolutions in favor of the Ike Dike, which envisions a barrier along Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Massive gates would close Bolivar Roads if a hurricane struck. It’s a plan to protect the whole bay. But critics ask good questions: — Some models suggest that a residual surge could be devastating. After the eye of a hurricane passed over the Ike Dike, the storm would produce surge in the bay, pushing water back toward Galveston. What protection would the Ike Dike provide? — Many of the houses on Galveston ’s West End are elevated to 15 feet. Is there going to be enough benefit to justify the cost of a wall in front of those homes? And if so, how high would that wall have to be? — The flood control systems in The Netherlands are more complicated than a single dike, and Bolivar Roads is formidable. Is a floodgate across that entrance to the bay even possible? And if it is, how do you justify the cost? There are many questions — and they ought to be treated as questions, rather than as criticisms. Somehow, it ought to be possible to get those who have high hopes for the Ike Dike and those opposed to come together for a discussion, rather than a fight. Both groups have something in common. The common ground is a belief that something should be done to prevent the kind of environmental disaster all parties can foresee. — Galveston County Daily News

 <i> New Orleans</i> BP could be looking at close to $18 billion in additional fines over the nation's worst offshore oil spill after a federal judge ruled Thursday that the company acted with "gross negligence" in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster. U.S. District Judge In the next stage of the case, set to begin in January, the judge will decide precisely how much BP must pay. Under the federal Clean Water Act, a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of $1,100 in civil fines per barrel of spilled oil, or up to $4,300 per barrel if the company is found grossly negligent. Barbier's finding exposes BP to the much higher amount. Even as the oil giant vowed to appeal, BP stock fell $2.82, or nearly 6 percent, to $44.89, reducing the company's market value by almost $9 billion. "Everybody talks about how big they are, but it's staggering," BP previously agreed to pay a record $4 billion in criminal fines and penalties over the Deepwater Horizon disaster, plus more than $27 billion in cleanup costs and compensation to people and businesses harmed by the spill. The company made $24 billion in profits last year but could be forced again to sell off some assets to cover the additional fines, analysts said. Attorney General Barbier held a non-jury trial last year to identify the blowout's causes and apportion blame for the disaster, and on Thursday he ruled that BP bears 67 percent of the responsibility, Swiss-based drilling rig owner BP made "profit-driven decisions" during the drilling that led to the blowout, the judge concluded in his 153-page ruling. "These instances of negligence, taken together, evince an extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks," he wrote. Among other things, the judge cited a misinterpreted safety test that should have warned the drilling crew that the well was in danger of blowing out. In a statement, BP said the evidence did not meet the "very high bar" to prove gross negligence. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=business&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22James+Roy%22">James Roy</a> Government experts estimated 4.2 million barrels, or 176 million gallons, spilled into the Gulf. BP urged the judge to use an estimate of 2.45 million barrels, or nearly 103 million gallons, in calculating any Clean Water Act penalties. Barbier hasn't ruled yet on how much oil spilled. If he goes with the government's estimate, BP could be hit with $18 billion in fines. The crude that gushed from the sea floor killed wildlife and polluted marshes. BP ultimately sealed the well after several methods failed. BP pleaded guilty in 2013 to manslaughter in the rig workers' deaths.

About $25 million in projects have been completed under a $136 million, 15-year plan that was announced in early 2014 by the state "We've completed $8 million in disinfection projects at the North and South plants," said Government grants paid for more that half that expense, he added. "This demonstrates that Albany County and our partners are committed to supporting clean water programs, protecting public health and improving the water quality in the Hudson River," McCoy said. Rensselaer County has installed a $2.5 million ultraviolet light disinfection system at its sewage treatment plant, said Those improvements also are expected to help business growth in the county, said County Executive Kathy Jimino. A Hudson River environmental group also touted the work so far. "Riverkeeper is encouraged by the significant work that's been accomplished in the first year of the Capital District's major effort to reduce pollution in the Hudson River," said For decades, the region's aging sewer systems have been fouling the river with about 1.2 billion gallons annually in rain-fueled sewage spills — called combined sewer overflows.

 NAIROBI, Kenya — Using hooks or their bare hands, men, women and children traipse through the murky sludge that pools around the mountains of garbage, hunting for bottles, plastic bags and anything else that can be recycled to earn themselves enough for their daily bread. The scavengers at Nairobi's notorious Dandora dump are some of the poorest of Kenya's poor — and they are likely to be on Pope Francis' mind when he makes his first trip to Africa Thursday to bring his message of environmental stewardship and care for society's most marginalized. His message will take on an even more poignant ring on a continent long wracked by poverty, war and disease. One of Francis' most anticipated speeches will be to the Nairobi-based U.N. Environment Program, which has warned that those working and living near Dandora suffer from a wide range of diseases including lung cancer, skin diseases and lead poisoning that cause stunted growth and mental disabilities in children. Francis has denounced how the poor suffer disproportionately from environmental degradation, especially the health effects of pollution, and at UNEP he is likely to call for governments to clean up their act ahead of crucial climate negotiations opening in Paris next week. He warned in his landmark encyclical "Praise Be" that the dumping of toxic, radioactive and industrial waste risks turning Earth into "an immense pile of filth." About 3,000 Kenyans must try to avoid used intravenous needles, diapers, surgical knives and other hazards as they pick through the 2,000 tons of garbage dumped here daily. They work alongside hundreds of Marabou storks that scavenge for carrion and scraps of food amid the stench. They are reluctant to accept that their bodies might be withering as a result of the waste, fearing that such an admission will convince the county government to shut down the dump — and their livelihoods. "I used to have nothing," said Mary Nyambura, a 47-year-old widowed mother of seven. She said the dump is her only means of survival. " But if I come here I am assured of at least $1 that can feed my family." An area legislator, James Gakuya, launched a lawsuit against the county government in 2014 seeking to close the dump, arguing that it was damaging the health of his other constituents in nearby residential areas. There was a proposal to relocate the dumpsite to the outskirts of the city. But the Kenya Airports Authority said the proposed locale was on a flight path for planes taking off and landing, and that the massive Marabous that circle overhead would endanger aircraft. The proposal was shot down. Faulu Nyokagi Mbugua, a 36-year-old business woman and single mother of two, says her health has deteriorated in the last two years as the dumpsite inched closer to her home. "I have breathing problems, I cannot eat," she said, wheezing. "Each time I smell the air, I vomit." But the Waste Pickers Association says the health concerns are overblown. "Those people who become sick don't eat a balanced diet, smoke too much, or have other conditions such as AIDS," said Samuel Goko, the association chairman. "Even pregnant women come and work here, and most of babies are born without defects." The pope knows well the plight of garbage pickers, having ministered for years to the "cartoneros" of Buenos Aires, who also pick through garbage looking for recyclable goods. Just last month, he baptized the son of the leader of the "cartoneros" in a small ceremony inside the Vatican. The child was named after the pope. Nyambura, the mother of seven, says she suffers from respiratory illnesses and skin diseases. But she says scavenging at the dump — from which she outfitted her one-room house with the mattresses her children sleep on and even the utensils they use — is better than being on the streets. On a recent day at the dump, Nyambura was accompanied by her youngest daughter, Joyce Njeri, age 8. She works at the dumpsite during school vacations, and has the sores and scratches on her feet to prove it. She says she doesn't like the work, which earns her 50 cents a day, split with her mother. Nyambura says she has no choice but to put her children to work to make ends meet. "It's better to scratch and cough and have something to eat. Now if they close, where will we go? " she asked.

 Give credit to town Parks and Recreation Director But his hoped-for remedy, creating all-weather artificial turf complexes at the town’s three middle schools, is the environmental equivalent of sweeping dangerous dirt under the rug. The town is spending $40,000 this year to study how best to incorporate synthetic fields into the campuses of Eastern, Western and I think the director’s hope is a pipe dream, and I expect his environmental consultants, AECON, will tell him so. Capping toxins in place only works for certain classes of poisons and only in sites with the appropriate underlying geology. And the only way to find out if capping would meet public health and safety regulations at the three middle schools is to test the soils. There is just no way around it. Like most towns, Greenwich has a chronic shortage of playing fields, at least on weekends when demand from sports leagues is highest. Artificial turf would make game schedules and practice sessions for school teams more reliable and reduce annual maintenance costs. However, in addition to the environmental concerns, there are neighborhood aesthetics that also need to be addressed. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= news&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Eastern+Middle+School%22">Eastern Middle School</a> Central Middle School neighbors face the same issues, though it affects far fewer homes than Eastern’s campus.

 Caption Close KETCHIKAN, Alaska (AP) — Authorities say the green water flowing in the Ketchikan Creek that caused some panic and drew a response from multiple agencies was the result of a prank. Officials have determined that the dye dumped into the water on Wednesday is non-toxic. Ketchikan police talked to the man responsible for the dye, but he was not arrested or cited. "It was just a prank," Officer Charles Johnson told The Ketchikan Daily News ( The Ketchikan Fire Department had also responded to the creek after reports of the green water around 4 p.m. While the incident may have initially been a concern for fire crews, police and residents who first discovered the green creek, Johnson said he did not see the activity as criminal. "They already confirmed that the substance was non-toxic. ... I think the biggest problem was the slight panic of everybody trying to respond to a possible environmental disaster when there wasn't one," Johnson said.

DEEP officials said the enforcement record is justified and stressed that regulators monitor permit compliance and determine what type of enforcement response is warranted. DEEP said the agency often works with companies to bring them into compliance. “Any violation is grounds for enforcement action, but that does not mean that all noncompliance is immediately actionable or always subject to formal enforcement and penalties,” said Still, Inglese conceded the mountain of monitoring data DEEP receives is so large that reviewing all of the information “far exceeds the capacity of department staff.” State Rep. “Personally, I think if companies are blatantly and maliciously disobeying the law, they should face consequences, regardless of what the state’s budget situation is,” Albis said. “The reality is that we need enforcement and compliance staff to ensure that this is happening, and in difficult budget times, these types of staff tend to be on the chopping block, or positions are not filled after retirements,” Albis said <strong>Not in compliance</strong> The federal Clean Water Act only allows companies with a The permit limits what kind of material can be discharged and the amount, and sets monitoring and reporting requirements to ensure discharges do not contaminate water and impact public health.

The C-HIT review found that, between October 2013 and September 2016, 19 companies exceeded their discharge limit by more than 100 percent. The data also showed that 23 of the 60 companies with NPDES permits were in noncompliance for at least half of the three year period studied for reasons ranging from excessive discharges to submitting late discharge reports. Thirteen companies were found in significant noncompliance — the most serious level of violation — for three months or more, the data showed. While DEEP has authority to fine or take court action against polluters, EPA records show it more commonly issues notices of violation for noncompliance or warning notices, opting to work with violators for months or years to correct the problems. <strong >Copper and iron</strong> Only two companies, Allnex USA of Wallingford and ReEnergy Sterling, were fined by DEEP for violations of their NPDES permits over the three-year period, the review found. DEEP levied a $52,000 fine in 2014 against Allnex, which discharged into the Quinnipiac River, and a $45,000 fine in 2014 against ReEnergy Sterling, which discharged into the Moosup River.

UniMetal President Connecticut Galvanizing was issued a violation notice in 2012 and two more in 2014 for exceeding discharge limits. By mid-2014, Inglese said DEEP “escalated the matter into a mediation effort between Connecticut Galvanizing and other involved parties” to allow the company to install a storm water treatment system required by its permit. But despite that effort, in late 2015 Connecticut Galvanizing discharged storm water runoff into the Salmon Brook containing 223,000 percent more zinc and 1,980 percent more lead than allowed, the C-HIT review found.

Inglese said DEEP’s enforcement response is focused on significant violations. “Any violation is grounds for enforcement action, but that does not mean that all noncompliance is immediately actionable or always subject to formal enforcement and penalties,” Inglese said. Companies found in noncompliance for months or years are not automatic candidates for fines, he explained. “Case-by-case circumstances vary and must be evaluated based on their specific situations,” he said. Inglese noted companies may be implementing “a long-term plan to reduce or eliminate noncompliance,” or are out of compliance because of an error on a permit application or “external impediments” beyond their control.

 Armstrong Court. Greenwich High School. Byram Park, home of Byram Beach on Long Island Sound. Greenwich Harbor. Western Middle School. The old town dump. Those are just the most notable areas of Greenwich where the soil is contaminated by thousands of tons of coal ash trucked away from the old New Haven Railroad Power Plant in Cos Cob, now the site of a park on the west bank of the Mianus River. There are hundreds of other, smaller contaminated sites as well, some of them public ball fields. This is not news to anyone who’s paid any attention to town affairs over the last two decades. But I thought about them again this very rainy week, and after reading and watching news coverage of the dramatic environmental impact of Hurricane Florence on North Carolina. Florence dumped more than 30 inches of rain across a good portion of the Tar Heel state, turning interstate highways into rivers and breaching dams that held back tens of millions of gallons of hog manure. It is tough to get one’s mind around just how much pig poop that is; even more confounding to contemplate the massive clean-up required. But Florence also breached levees that held tons and tons of coal ash. That poisonous mix is now flowing through rivers and streams and affecting drinking water supplies. Greenwich has no pig farms, at least none that I know. The town does, however, share a toxic legacy with North Carolina and other states: tons of coal ash spread across wide swaths of land, the residue of an era when coal was king and the primary fuel for generating electricity and powering all manner of industrial activity. Most of the coal ash in Greenwich came from the Cos Cob power plant. Anyone growing up in Riverside in the 1950s and ’60s remembers days when coal ash traced a brown trail across the sky, riding northwest winds over the water. A mountain of ash grew next to the power plant for decades, and eventually the railroad needed to find other dump sites. Not yet knowing of coal ash’s poisons, the material was used as fill in building sites across Greenwich, including Ten Acre Swamp, the piece of land off Hillside Drive and East Putnam Avenue on which the town later built Greenwich High School. But the environmental movement of the 1970s led to a deeper concern over what man was doing to his environment, and coal ash turned out to be one of the most widespread toxic materials. It is a toxic brew that can include lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, selenium and too many other -iums to list here. Some of those substances are carcinogens; others damage human organs and cause serious medical conditions. (For a good itemization and description of toxins in coal ash, visit earthjustice.org, and search for "Harm to Health from Breathing and Ingesting Coal Ash Toxicants.") Discovery of the detrimental health effects of coal ash did not stop disposal of it at Ten Acre Swamp, even after it had become GHS. There are photos from construction there in 2005 that indicate the use of coal ash as fill during the renovation of Cardinal Stadium’s field. Documentation exists of dumping at many other public spaces in Greenwich - and much of it is still present on the original power plant site. And, of course, coal ash does not stay in place once it is dumped. Surface water and underground streams spread the dangerous material. This week’s substantial rain and significant flooding is not just a reminder that Greenwich’s storm water drainage system is antiquated and inadequate; it is also a reminder of the powerful force of moving water and its ability to spread toxic material along a much bigger area than the original dump sites. Greenwich has for decades turned a blind eye to the health risks of coal ash and contaminated soil and riverbeds. As I wrote at the beginning of this column, coal ash and soil contamination are old stories in Greenwich. Equally as old a story is the refusal by town government to make any proactive efforts to identify and remediate contaminated sites, even those regularly used by school children and adults But perhaps the many new RTM members elected last year will start to take an interest in the town’s laissez-faire attitude toward cleaning up dirty dirt. First Selectman Peter Tesei has described townwide testing for toxic soil as a "fool’s errand. " Not long after he made that comment during the 2015 campaign, Western Middle School fields were closed because tests revealed dangerous levels of various toxins from coal ash. The tests were done privately at the request of an RTM member. Town government’s first reaction was to challenge the test results and refer the professional who took the tests to the state Board of Health for disciplinary action. Then they did close the playing fields. How many more thousands of people will be exposed to the health threats posed by coal ash before the town takes substantive action? <em >Bob Horton can be reached at bobhorton@yahoo.com.</em>

FAIRFIELD — The town began investigating Gould Manor Park on Wednesday after reports of potential asbestos that may have come from the fill pile managed by Julian Enterprises. The town said in a news release it had been made aware of what appear to be siding shingles potentially containing asbestos along the sidewalk of Gould Manor Park on Holland Hill Road. Fill and topsoil from the fill pile in Richard White Way were used in renovations of the sidewalk in 2013 and 2014. The fill pile, which Julian Enterprises began managing just before the sidewalk project began in 2013, is the subject of a This week, Public Works employees Scott Bartlett and Joseph Michelangelo, as well as Jason Julian, the co-owner of Julian Enterprises, were By request of town’s Health Department, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection went to the park Wednesday to collect soil samples. Reports say that prosecutors and investigators from the Chief State’s Attorney’s office were also present at the site. The town has requested the testing results be expedited and should be available next week. Out of “an abundance of caution,” the town said, it will meet with subject matter experts tomorrow and will put in place any recommended interim controls to limit potential exposure. “We’re taking this very seriously,” said First Selectman Mike Tetreau at Wednesday’s Board of Selectmen meeting. The town said the asbestos detected in the siding shingles at the park is non-friable, meaning that it cannot be easily reduced to a powder by hand. The town also stated the area of concern is limited to the sidewalk and does not appear to have impacted the park, playground or ball fields. It is working to identify any other town sites where fill from the pile managed by Julian may have been used. Dana Kery, a resident of the Gould Manor Park neighborhood and Republican candidate for RTM District 7, said she submitted a complaint about what she believed was glass and asbestos in the fill by the sidewalk back in 2014. Kery claims she reached out multiple times to Bartlett, Michelangelo, Tetreau and then-Selectmen Cristin McCarthy Vahey and Kevin Kiley. According to emails obtained by the Fairfield Citizen, Kery met with Bartlett at the site in April 2015. While Kery said she was not satisfied with remediation efforts at the site, emails show that Bartlett sent her updates in May 2015 and she thanked him for removing concerning material from the sidewalk area. At the Board of Selectmen meeting, Tetreau said he had not been not aware of concerns about hazardous material at Gould Manor Park until this Tuesday. When asked about Kery’s correspondence in 2014, Tetreau said he did not recall this, and if Michelangelo had been copied on the email he would have asked Michelangelo to follow up on it directly. <em > This story has been updated to reflect additional emails obtained by the Fairfield Citizen. </em > <em>rscharf@hearstmediact.com</em>

 < i>New York</i> Dylan Sharbonier and two other construction workers were hanging a green tarp on the fence surrounding one of 13 lead-tainted ballfields in Red Hook, Brooklyn, this month, their fingers red from below-freezing temperatures. "We need to get these fields open by spring," Sharbonier said. "The kids need these fields." Locals are more circumspect. Wally Bazemore, who grew up nearby in the Red Hook Houses and coached baseball here for years, said he would be thrilled to see the fields open soon. " But I doubt they're going to be open for summer," he said. "We won't see any baseball until 2021. And that's if they do it right. And we want them to do it right." The housing projects here, as well as the adjacent ballfields, were built on top of a lead smelting site dating back to the 1920s. Over the years, thousands of soccer and baseball teams played on those fields until they were closed in 2012 and 2015. After a series of delays, the city finally started moving the contaminated soil out this past August. Since then, nearly 4,800 tons of tainted dirt have been hauled from the area, just a fraction of what's still buried. As part of a complicated, four-phase, $100 million plan, the city's parks department has been moving contaminated soil out since last summer. This month, workers started digging out the next big load — around 9,000 tons — for the second phase of the project. LAWS Construction, assigned the cleanup of phase one and two so far, is removing the dirt under the observation of the state Department of Environmental Conservation, the federal Environmental Protection Agency and community activists. "I was just there watching the other day," said Bazemore, who played baseball on the fields for decades. "We need to keep an eye on things. Like Ronald Reagan used to say, 'Trust but verify.'" The big question: How do you safely remove thousands of tons of toxic topsoil, and where does it go? It is a long and slow process. Unlike asbestos, the particles of which can linger in the air during an abatement, lead is heavy, which means that removal is not as risky, but keeping it in the ground is. So in the spring, a small team of workers in Tyvek suits, gloves and goggles began stripping 6 inches of soil from the Lorraine Street fields, the most highly contaminated of the sites, situated directly across from the Red Hook housing projects. Using front loaders, excavators and bulldozers, workers placed soil in piles on the edges of the site, covered with large tarps. All but a few pockets of soil have been dug up on the first site. Thirty-nine trees have been removed, and 62 will be replanted. Then in the summer, a small convoy of dump trucks — each weighing between 18 and 20 tons — began moving the soil out of the neighborhood, their tires and undercarriages hosed down with a pressure washer to remove any contamination before heading out. The trucks then take a route away from the Red Hook Houses for a 90-minute-long highway drive to the Fairless Landfill in Falls Township, Pennsylvania, a town of around 33,000 people across the Delaware River from Trenton, New Jersey. Any recyclable concrete from the site is being shipped to Allocco Recycling in Brooklyn, a scrap yard near Newtown Creek. "Some local residents asked, 'Why don't we move it out by barge?'" said Martin Maher, head of Brooklyn Parks. Maher and his team researched the possibility but found it would actually involve more trucks, require more loading and unloading of the contaminated material and cost twice as much. The area is regularly sprayed with water to keep dust to a minimum, and the air is continually monitored for contamination, with results posted at the local Red Hook Library. If all goes according to plan and winter is not too harsh, the ballfields in phase one should be open by late spring and the entire project completed by 2023.

 Caption Close DENVER — Beneath the western United States lie thousands of old mining tunnels filled with the same toxic stew that spilled into a Colorado river last week, turning it into a nauseating yellow concoction and stoking alarm about contamination of drinking water. Though the spill into the Animas River in southern Colorado is unusual for its size, it’s only the latest instance of the region grappling with the legacy of a centuries-old mining boom that helped populate the region but also left buried toxins. Until the late 1970s there were no regulations on mining in most of the region, meaning anyone could dig a hole where they liked and search for gold, silver, copper or zinc. Abandoned mines fill up with groundwater and snowmelt that becomes tainted with acids and heavy metals from mining veins which can trickle into the region’s waterways. Experts estimate there are 55,000 such abandoned mines from Colorado to California, and federal and state authorities have struggled to clean them for decades. The federal government says 40 percent of the headwaters of Western waterways have been contaminated from mine runoff. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency was trying to staunch leakage from a gold mine — not worked since 1923 — high in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado. But workers moving debris from the mine tunnel accidentally opened up the passage, leading to 3 million gallons of sludge spilling into a creek that carried it into the Animas River. From there the discharge headed toward the Colorado River, which provides water to tens of millions of Westerners. “The whole acid draining issue is something we struggle with in the western United States,” said Bruce Stover, the Colorado Department of Mining official in charge of dealing with abandoned mines in that state. But the Wednesday spill from the Gold King mine shows the amount of damage that the slightest cleanup accident can inflict. The mine is one of four outside the old mining town of Silverton that have leaked heavy metals into Cement Creek, which flows into the Animas. Cement Creek is so poisoned that no fish live there and the EPA has long registered abnormal levels of acidity and heavy metals in the upper Animas that have also injured aquatic life. Downstream, though, the Animas flows through the scenic town of Durango and is a magnet for summer vacationers, fishermen and rafters. The river turned yellow Thursday, emitting a sickening stench and sending water agencies scrambling to shut off the taps from the waterway.

A toxicology team gathers samples inside a school where samples were tested for PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, as well as dioxins and furans. Ted S. Warren | AP The Environmental Protection Agency and lawmakers have quietly abandoned efforts to rid schools of toxic PCBs, leaving districts — especially in poor areas — with a difficult choice: Look for the long-banned chemicals, which could trigger a costly cleanup, or simply clean their buildings as well as possible. Many older buildings have caulk, ceiling tiles, floor adhesives and paint made with PCBs, sometimes at levels far higher than allowed by law. And millions of PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts probably remain in older schools and day care centers, where they can leak, smolder and catch fire. Yet the Environmental Protection Agency never attempted to determine the scope of PCB contamination or assess potential health risks because of a lack of funding, political pressure and pushback from industry and education groups, according to dozens of interviews and thousands of pages of documents examined by The Associated Press. Members of Congress who promised three years ago to find money to help schools address PCBs and other pollutants never introduced legislation. At the EPA, a rule to require schools and day cares to remove PCB-containing ballasts moved slowly under the Obama administration and then was quashed by President Donald Trump as part of deregulation efforts. Tom Simons, a now-retired EPA regulator who worked on the rule, said getting rid of ballasts was the least the EPA could do to protect children. “We thought it was a no-brainer: There are millions out there. These things are smoking and dripping, so let’s put this through,” Simons said. PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, have been linked to increased long-term risks of cancer, immune and reproductive impairment and learning problems. They were manufactured by Monsanto Co. and used as coolants and lubricants in electrical equipment until they were banned in 1979. By then, they were in transformers, air conditioners, adhesives and billions of light ballasts in schools, hospitals, homes, offices and commercial and industrial buildings. They also were ubiquitous in the environment and building up in human bodies. But nobody worried about schools. Then a 2004 study by Harvard health professor Robert Herrick identified the widespread use of PCBs in caulk in schools built before 1980, estimating that up to 26,000 buildings and 14 million students could be affected. The EPA later found PCBs in caulk and other materials could get into the air or dust and be absorbed by walls and other surfaces. The agency also discovered that many older schools still were using PCB-containing fluorescent light ballasts. In California’s wealthy Santa Monica-Malibu School District, parents, including model Cindy Crawford, sued after tests of caulk found PCB levels up to 11,000 times the EPA’s threshold. The district ultimately agreed to get rid of PCBs. It has torn down a middle school and continues to remove them from other buildings. In Hartford, Connecticut, an elementary school in a low-income African American neighborhood was closed because the city could not afford to remove PCBs. The city has sued Monsanto and a company that made caulk to recover the costs. “It was the crown jewel of the neighborhood,” former city council member Steven Harris said of J.C. Clark Elementary. “Our school board is doing the best they can. The reality is we don’t have a lot of money.” Monsanto, now owned by Bayer Crop Sciences, has denied responsibility in lawsuits involving several school districts. The company said there is no proof PCBs cause significant health problems, especially at levels found in buildings. Experts say proving PCBs caused specific illnesses is daunting and could be impossible because problems can take years to develop and not everyone who’s exposed will get sick. But parents and teachers who say they were exposed to PCBs at a public alternative school in Monroe, Washington, are trying to do just that. They believe that dripping and smoking light ballasts made them sick, and they have filed their own lawsuit. Either way, it’s crucial to reduce the chemicals in schools because children are more vulnerable and continued exposure begins to “chisel away at the margin of safety” and could increase the odds of long-term health problems, said Mark Maddaloni, a former EPA toxicologist. Former officials said the EPA was hamstrung by a politically fraught problem that could cost billions of dollars. What’s more, many schools also had other high-priority pollutants such as lead, asbestos and mold. So instead of requiring — or encouraging — schools to test for PCBs, the EPA recommended thorough cleaning and ventilation and said districts could cover materials that might contain PCBs until buildings were renovated or razed. That guidance outlined important steps schools could take to reduce exposure regardless of their finances, said Tom Huetteman, former assistant director of the PCB program at San Francisco-based EPA Region 9. “It would be great if there was zero exposure in schools, but that’s not the world we live in,” Huetteman said.

 <i>Stillwater</i> Monday's raw sewage spill at Saratoga Lake has prompted the county sewer district to consider options to avoid future problems. Saratoga County Sewer District Executive Director "The thing about the alarms is they would have worked in this case, but no one will hear them in the middle of the woods," said Rourke of the spill that took place on Route 9P in Stillwater. "The drain option will keep the sewage circulating until one of us comes out there to check on the pump station." Rourke said his crew maintains 96 pump stations and each one is checked every couple of days. Monday's spill was discovered by a resident who called the district office in Mechanicville where crews are available 24 hours a day. "We rely on residents to call if they see something," said Rourke. "If you call us, we will dispatch someone. If you see something, say something." The July 4th spill, which poured an estimated 5,000 gallons of raw sewage into the popular lake, was reported at 10 a.m. and contained by 1 p.m. The crew vacuumed what it could off the ground and transported it to the Mechanicville plant for treatment.

 Caption Close An overturned tractor-trailer in Vacaville Monday sent some 6,000 gallons of organic sunflower oil cascading out of its busted casing and oozing down a nearby storm drain. The crash, which involved no other vehicles, was reported by a passing motorist around 11:08 a.m. at the Davis Street off-ramp to Interstate 80 in Vacaville, fire officials said. The driver of the big rig was transported to a nearby trauma center with serious, but non-life threatening, injuries, said Battalion Chief It was not immediately clear what caused the crash, but it may have been related to an underlying medical condition of the driver, Mahlberg said. He did not know whether alcohol or drugs were involved. The driver appeared “a little dazed and confused” as passing motorists helped him out of the overturned truck, Mahlberg said. A hazardous materials team was initially dispatched to the crash site before emergency responders realized that they were dealing with organic sunflower oil, Mahlberg said. The trucking company, the name of which was not immediately identified, had dispatched a private cleanup company from Santa Rosa to mop up the sticky mess. The 6,000 gallons of oil burst from a massive plastic container inside the truck’s trailer. Though it was reinforced with metal ribbing, the force of the crash caused the container to rupture. Concerned about the viscous oil entering the storm drain system, Mahlberg said public works crews were able to bring in tons of sand in dump trucks that prevented the oil from spreading into the run-off system. No other cars were involved in the crash, and no one else was injured, Mahlberg said. A number of additional agencies, including the Th off-ramp to Interstate 80 and Davis Street around the scene of the crash were closed, and expected to reopen later Monday. <em> </em > <em><a href="/search/?action = search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Michael+Bodley%22">Michael Bodley</a> is a <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22San+Francisco+Chronicle%22">San Francisco Chronicle</a> staff writer.

Illinois Environmental Protection Agency workers in protective suits and respirators work following a hazardous material spill in Hamel earlier this month. Melissa Pitts | Intelligencer File Photo HAMEL — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul has filed a lawsuit and a motion for a preliminary injunction in Madison County Circuit Court against PDC Services, Inc., after a semitrailer spilled electric arc furnace dust, a hazardous waste, on a public road in the village of Hamel. “This spill resulted in a significant amount of a hazardous waste being dumped onto the roadway, jeopardizing public health and the environment,” Raoul said. “My office filed this lawsuit to ensure that the company continues to cooperate with efforts to clean up the contamination and address any additional effects to residents, businesses and vehicles.” On June 11, a semitrailer operated by PDC Services based in Peoria reportedly spilled at least 1,000 pounds of EAF dust at the intersection of Illinois 140 and Illinois 157 in Hamel. According to a news release from Raoul’s office, the driver of the semitrailer suddenly applied his brakes, causing the load in the trailer to shift and tear through the tarp on the top of the trailer, which had been held in place by rubber bungee cords. EAF dust, a byproduct of the steelmaking process, is considered toxic because it contains lead, cadmium and hexavalent chromium. The lawsuit and motion seek to require PDC Services to complete the removal of all EAF dust in the area of the spill. In addition to the filings, the court entered an agreed injunction order requiring PDC Services to further investigate the site to determine the full extent of the contamination and to clean up the impacted area. The order also requires PDC Services to submit a report describing what caused the spill and how the company plans to prevent future spills. PDC Services also must decontaminate the exterior and interior of any vehicle that drove through the EAF dust on the roadway at the request of the vehicle’s owner. The case was referred to the Attorney General’s office by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. “This incident significantly impacted the local environment and directly impacted residents, along with personal and commercial property,” said Illinois EPA Director John J. Kim. “This action will ensure the company is committed to the remediation of environmental impacts and any impacts to the local community, and Illinois EPA will work closely with Attorney General Raoul to bring this incident to closure.” Assistant Attorneys General Raymond Callery and Natalie Long are handling the case for Raoul’s Environmental Bureau.

Caption Close LaPorte, Shoreacres and Baytown residents are ordered to stay put and sheltered during the 'chemical emergency.' LaPorte, Shoreacres and Baytown residents are ordered to stay put and sheltered during the 'chemical emergency.' La Porte firefighters and a Harris County hazmat team have contained a chemical spill Monday after a pipeline ruptured on the northeast side of La Porte in the petrochemical district about 20 miles east of downtown Houston. Around 4:30 p.m. Monday, residents of La Porte, Baytown and Shoreacres were warned to shelter in place - meaning they should stay inside, shut off air conditioning and close doors and windows. La Porte police and the city of Shoreacres signaled shortly after 7 p.m. that the incident was resolved. No injuries were reported. "We have given the all clear," La Porte Police Sgt. Bennie Boles said in a statement. " Roadways are opened." "The chemical release has been contained," The chemical that leaked just north of the interchange between Texas 225 and Texas 146 was anhydrous hydrogen chloride, "which presents symptoms of eye, throat, and nasal irritation," according to a statement issued by the city of La Porte. A Residents were ordered to shelter in place on La Porte's northeast side, in the area contained by Farrington Road on the west, North Avenue H on the south and Texas 146 on the east. As a result, the city of Baytown said the Fred Hartman Bridge was closed over the Houston Ship Channel. A hazmat team from the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office was on scene by 6:30 p.m., agency spokeswoman Rachel Moreno said. They worked with local firefighters and the pipeline company, as Harris County pollution control officials monitored air quality. "Our team has cleared the scene and is headed home," Moreno said about 7:30 p.m. La Porte residents had started posting on the city's Facebook page about 5 p.m. asking why sirens were going off and seeking information. The city did not post about the shelter-in-place order until after 5:30 p.m. Amy Martin, a La Porte resident, said she received an automated text message, phone call and email from the city with instructions to shelter in place because of a "chemical emergency." The outdoor sirens began to sound a few minutes later, Martin said. She added that she shut off her air conditioning, as instructed, and had yet to get the all-clear as of 6:20 p.m. A local TV station reported that the spill came from a Valero pipeline, but a company spokeswoman said the incident did not involve the company's infrastructure. "It's not our asset," Valero spokeswoman Lillian Riojas told the Chronicle in an email. " Hopefully the city of La Porte can identify the company." The La Porte Police Department did not identify the owner but said that "the company responsible for the line and the cause of the leak is being investigated and will be determined at a later date."

 Towering flames and plumes of jet black smoke poured from the flooded Arkema plant in Crosby as volatile chemicals exploded late Friday afternoon. One container caught fire, and the heat from that fire ignited a second container about 25 feet away, said Arkema executive Richard Rennard. The dramatic display was the latest chapter of a chemical disaster, caused, in part, by floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey. <strong> HIDDEN DANGER:<a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Chemical-facilities-face-danger-during-Harvey-12160003.php" target="_blank" title="Chemical facilities face danger during Harvey shutdowns" > </a></strong> Caption Close Authorities have evacuated residents within a mile and a half of the facility and said the fumes from the fire don't pose an immediate public threat. The Environmental Protection Agency is conducting air and water tests in the area. Arkema is a maker of organic peroxides commonly used by the plastics and rubber industries. They must be kept in cool temperatures or they can explode. The Arkema plant lost power earlier this week, knocking out the primary supply and backup generators and forcing employees to move the organic peroxides into nine box vans with cooling systems, which soon began to fail. The company has abandoned the facility and any hope of preventing the chemicals from catching fire. Rennard said the company believes any fires from the containers won't spread to the plant itself. Despite the explosions and noxious fumes, Arkema has refused to provide a chemical inventory and facility map to the public. Speaking to reporters Friday morning, Arkema CEO Richard Rowe said the company was balancing "the public's right to know and the public's right to be secure." That answer wasn't good enough for Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. "There's no good reason they shouldn't be putting this information out," he said. "It makes it look like they're hiding something." There's little patience or sympathy for Arkema from Crosby residents near the plant. Philip Mincey had evacuated from his home about a quarter of a mile from Arkema because of floodwaters. He bought the place a year ago. There's enough land that he and his girlfriend can raise four cows, a cat and 30 to 40 chickens. Now, Mincey can't get back to their property. He's worried about their animals, and he's tired of the lack of communication from Arkema about when he will get temporary housing. He doesn't know when he can return home, and he wonders about the dangers of the inevitable explosions from the plant. "At first, I was understanding; it was an accident," Mincey said. "But now, they're jerking us around." Late Thursday night, the company provided a list of the chemicals on the site. But the potential hazards they pose remain unclear because the company did not provide the amounts of the chemicals, where those chemicals were located, or in what types of containers the chemicals were stored. Melissa Wren, a company spokeswoman, said Arkema was advised by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to refer all requests for the detailed chemical inventory, called a Tier Two, to the state agency. "She's mistaken," said Andrea Morrow, spokeswoman for TCEQ. " (The agency) has told Arkema they are free to release the Tier Two if they so choose." Morrow said if someone requests the Tier Two from TCEQ, it will have to be through a formal public information request and it would be sent to the Texas Attorney General's Office. That office, under Greg Abbott and now Ken Paxton, has blocked inventories from the public citing a state law that restricts information that might be useful to terrorists. The Texas Homeland Security Act, passed in 2003, made government information confidential if it could be used to plot terror attacks. For more than a decade, the law was never invoked to block release of chemical inventories. The state reversed course after widespread media interest in the data following the 2013 explosion at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas. <strong>PUBLIC ACCESS DENIED:</strong> Arkema has responded to some questions about what led to the emergency. Daryl Roberts, a company safety official, said neutralizing the organic peroxide with another chemical was not practical and that "at no point" did they intend to destroy it. The company initially considered relocating the chemicals but deemed that process too risky, Roberts said. "For us to be in a position where we were going to put that material into trailers and try to move it, it runs the risk of not being able to get it out of the area or getting it stuck in traffic, or having a fire or an explosion at a highway or at a public area, versus in the rural area where this site is," he said. Roberts confirmed two chemicals contained on its government mandated worst-case scenario report -- sulfur dioxide and isobutylene. They were located hundreds of yards from the organic peroxides exploding on the site, he said. "There's no issues with any of those materials," Roberts said. "No fire or water damage. No degradation in any of the systems that you're asking about." The company left the material on site with backup generators and a cooling system, but the company didn't say whether the generators were elevated. "Those were our levels of contingency," Roberts said. "Clearly, that wasn't enough." Company officials have said they expected the refrigeration to fail in all the trailers and that additional explosions are inevitable for the six remaining containers. The six containers that remain but located in a more remote location of the plant, said Arkema officials. Bob Royall, assistant chief of the Harris County Fire Marshal's Office, said he believed they could explode in a matter of days as temperatures continue to rise. "Wish I had a crystal ball," he said. <em><strong >CHEMICAL BREAKDOWN:</strong> In November 2014, four workers died at a DuPont plant in La Porte after being exposed to a toxic gas.

The indictments by a Harris County grand jury are rare. Though unpermitted hazardous materials facilities have been allowed to flourish in the city's unzoned sprawl, catching chemical waste dumpers — or merely getting an inventory of all the haz-mat sites around town — has proven difficult for the Houston Fire Department. Prosecutors said they want this case to institute a new era of accountability for environmental crimes, relying on new lines of communication with the community to ferret out wrongdoers. "If you're operating without a license and handling hazardous waste, discharging hazardous waste, disposing of it, we're going after you," said Alex Forrest, chief of the environmental crimes division of the Harris County District Attorney's Office. <em><strong >RELATED VIDEO: </strong></em> At Wright Containers, named in the indictments Thursday, the injured employees turned into whistleblowers, Forrest said. They complained that the chemicals burned through their gloves and irritated their eyes. The company refused to pay for their medical care, they told investigators. Police officers searching the site with a warrant smelled strong chemical odors and felt more nauseous the closer they got to the drain, he said. "Some of the chemicals would burn the skin off your bones," he said. Owner Ronald F. Wright, 50, and general manager Gregory B. Hance, 41, each face two counts of intentional water pollution and one count of improper disposal and storage of hazardous materials. If convicted, they could face up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The company is also named as a defendant. No one answered the phone at the business on Friday afternoon and an attorney for the men did not immediately return messages. They turned themselves into authorities Friday and were released without bail, Forrest said. He did not know why, but said neither man has a criminal record, neither was deemed a flight risk and a court barred them from handling chemicals while the case is pending. < a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/chemical-breakdown/6/"><strong>READ MORE: A Chronicle investigation in 2016 found problems with chemical storage</strong></a> Wright Containers, in the 6600 block of Lindbergh Street in southeast Houston, is a few blocks away from Seguin Elementary School and hundreds of homes. Two other schools are nearby. It deals in hefty industrial-strength containers, made of thick plastic, holding up to 330 gallons of liquid and encased in metal cages mounted on pallets. Workers stacked the chemical "totes" around the property's central storm drain to block it from public view, Forrest said. The company offered recycled totes to industrial customers. "Wright Containers will pick up your dirty and empty" totes, the company's website says, adding that Wright's relatively small size allows it to undercut the competition. Forrest said there was no evidence that companies sending totes to Wright Containers knew how the waste was being disposed. "When you are receiving dirty totes for free ... and if you're not paying fees associated with properly collecting and disposing of hazardous waste ... then obviously when you're refurbishing that tote you're going to sell it at a much cheaper price," he said. The website indicated the company uses "a proprietary chemical treatment" to recondition used totes. But Forrest said the company had its employees cut the containers into pieces to be thrown away, then re-outfitted the metal cages with other totes. The company opened in 2017 and had plans for a second location in Sulphur, Louisiana. It has customers from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and other states. A whistleblower provided video of chemicals being dumped into the drain, which ultimately leads to Sims Bayou and then Galveston Bay, Forrest said. "We depend on our law-enforcement agencies, concerned citizens and whistleblowers to develop and communicate the intelligence and information we need to shut down these hazardous operations," he said. "The community truly is our eyes and ears, and we want the public to know we are here." A 2016 investigation by the Houston Chronicle found that the fire department had no idea where most hazardous chemicals are, that less than a quarter of hazardous materials facilities with permits had been inspected, and little effort was being made to find ones skirting the rules. Chemical facilities are sprinkled across neighborhoods and aren't always obvious. A fire at a chemical warehouse in Spring Branch in 2016 triggered evacuations of schools and homes, and caught neighbors and the fire department off guard. Updating the city database of hazmat facilities has been slow. <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/A-year-later-Houston-still-in-the-dark-on-11066782.php"><strong >READ MORE: A year later Houston is still in dark on chemical stockpiles</strong></a> The extent of any environmental damage at Wright Containers was unclear Friday. State and local environmental officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment about any cleanup efforts. The dumped chemicals included benzene, ethylbenzene, butylbenzene, dichloromethane, ethylbenzene and toluene, among others. Some are carcinogenic and highly flammable. It was impossible for investigators to estimate how much had been dumped into the drain over several months, Forrest said. Wright Containers did not have the required permits for handling hazardous waste, he said. An online Texas Commission on Environmental Quality database of regulated companies shows nothing under the company's name. District Attorney Kim Ogg said the indictments come as the result of a joint investigation with the Houston Police Department's Environmental Crimes Unit. "Polluters who intentionally poison our environment with toxic and corrosive substances, who disregard the health of our people, and who cut corners on the handling of hazardous waste to make an extra buck are on notice," Ogg said. "We will prosecute aggressively and resolutely when the evidence justifies it."

 Caption Close Oil and gas drilling in Texas shale plays pollutes the air, erodes soil and contaminates water, while the disposal of millions of gallons of wastewater causes earthquakes, a consortium of the state’s top scientists concluded. In the most comprehensive analysis of the environmental and social impacts of drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the “We’re seeing these activities in places we haven’t seen before. And we’re seeing them at an increasing scale, pace and intensity,” said The analysis is likely to increase the scrutiny of fracking, particularly as a second shale boom gets underway in the Permian Basin in West Texas and other shale plays in the state. No one, including the scientists who conducted the study, expect oil and gas companies to slow production. But the report may boost pressure on the firms to drill more carefully, keep operations out of populated areas, and consider more environmentally friendly fracking technologies. Houston’s Apache Corp., for instance, is experimenting with a large-scale water recycling program in West Texas, where it has come under significant scrutiny as it develops a new oil field near Balmorhea State Park and local springs that provide water for farming, drinking supplies and the park’s famous pool. The Texas  Parks & Wildlife Department, meanwhile, has launched an unprecedented study of wildlife, plants and water nearby to monitor the environmental impact of Apache’s project. Hydraulic fracturing remains controversial, across the country and around the world. States like Maryland, New York and Vermont have banned the practice, as have countries like France, Germany and Scotland. Counties in California, New Mexico and Colorado, among others, have tried with some success. Even Denton, a North Texas city of about 130,00, adopted a fracking ban before the “There’s significant debate in the public about shale development,” said The Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science of Texas is the state’s top scientific community. It includes all of the state’s Nobel  laureates, plus Texas-based members of the It launched its fracking review two years ago, putting together a task force of attorneys, geologists, seismologists and engineers, including representatives from oil companies and an environmental group. The group’s conclusions are based on the review and analysis of hundreds of academic studies, many involving Texas oil and gas operations. The report noted that the state has no single database tracking environmental impacts, no system for conducting regular research on plants and animals affected, and little detail on wastewater spills from shale drilling and fracking. There is also limited data concerning exposure to toxins in the air. The report calls for the state to do better in monitoring and collecting data. In addition to highlighting concerns, the report also aimed to correct misstatements and misunderstandings about shale drilling. For example, surface spills, not fracking, are the most likely drinking water contaminants, the study found. Oil reservoirs are typically so much deeper than freshwater aquifers that contamination between the two is “unlikely,” the report said, “and it has not been observed in Texas.” And the study found little evidence to connect shale oil production emissions to health effects, adding  there isn’t much research on the issue. “There are a lot of people who are afraid of hydraulic fracturing,” said But the 204-page report still found a litany of worries about fracking and suggested a bevy of new research. Specifically:    “I’m a seismologist,” said David.hunn@chron.com

 BROOKHAVEN, Miss. (AP) — A levee breach at a wastewater treatment plant in Brookhaven, Mississippi, has dumped six million gallons of diluted sewage into the Bogue Chitto river. That prompted water quality warnings along that river, which is popular for recreational use, from southwest Mississippi into southeast Louisiana. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality says the city has made repairs since Friday's breach, ending the flow of sewage, which was diluted by storm water. But the department warned against swimming, wading or eating fish from the Bogue Chitto until further notice. Louisiana's departments of Health and Environmental Quality issued a similar warning Saturday. Dr. Jimmy Guidry, Louisiana's state Health Officer, said the sewage release can result in elevated levels of harmful bacteria that can cause diarrhea, sore throats, stomach cramps or vomiting.
