newsTextToCSV("DENVER — A plume of mustard-colored muck that spilled from a Colorado mine was inching downstream Friday as frustrated state and local officials awaited word from federal agencies on the kind of pollutants staining the water.An estimated 1 million gallons of contaminated wastewater is flowing through the Animas River, and it is acidic and contains heavy metals, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said. But the agency still was running tests to see exactly what the sludge contained as it creeps toward communities in northern New Mexico. “We’re having a real problem getting EPA to tell us what’s in this stuff, ” said Don Cooper, emergency manager for San Juan County, New Mexico.  “We’re just kind of shooting in the dark and telling people to stay away from it. ”After the polluted water gushed from the shuttered Gold King Mine on Wednesday, the EPA warned people to stay out of the river popular with boaters and anglers and to keep domestic animals from drinking from it.There have been no reports of drinking-water contamination because water utilities shut down their intake valves ahead of the plume to keep it out of their systems. Farmers also closed the gates on their irrigation ditches to protect their crops, and Colorado officials were testing the effects on fish.New Mexico officials were angry they were not told of the spill until Thursday, nearly a day after it occurred. “New Mexico deserves better, ” state Environment Secretary Ryan Flynn said.The EPA didn’t respond to a request for comment on the criticism.Few details have been released about the spill, except that a cleanup crew accidentally breached a containment structure. The crew was trying to enter the mine as part of a project to pump and treat the water, EPA spokeswoman Lisa McClain-Vanderpool said.The waste spilled into Cement Creek, which flows into the Animas River north of the historic mining town of Silverton in Colorado’s San Juan Mountains.The river is a recreational destination and even served as the backdrop for parts of the movie  “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. ” Passengers on the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad snap thousands of photos of the waterway as the steam-powered trains chug up the narrow canyon beside it. “It’s such a shame, it’s such a beautiful river, ” said Jeff McCoy, who was watching from the riverbank in Durango, where he was on a fishing trip with his son.The heavy metals were making the plume travel more slowly than expected, and it was unclear how far it would reach or when it would dissipate, officials said. Extra water was being released from a reservoir to help dilute the pollution.The Animas River flows into New Mexico’s San Juan River, which is home to some endangered fish and joins the Colorado River in Utah.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("WASHINGTON — Authorities say rivers in the West tainted by the massive spill from an abandoned Colorado gold mine are starting to recover, but for the Environmental Protection Agency the political fallout from the disaster could linger.The federal agency’s critics are already seeking to use its much-maligned handling of the mine spill to undercut the Obama administration’s rollout of major regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions at the nation’s power plants. Members of oversight committees in both the House and Senate say they are planning hearings after Congress returns from its August recess.  “The EPA is supposed to help prevent environmental catastrophes, not cause them, ” said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., a member of the House leadership and the Energy and Commerce Committee.  “But, sadly, President Obama’s EPA has been too busy threatening American jobs with radical regulations instead of focusing on what should be their core mission. ” EPA and contract workers accidentally unleashed 3 million gallons of contaminated wastewater as they inspected the idled Gold King mine on Aug. 5, just two days after Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan during an event at the White House.The timing could hardly be worse for the beleaguered regulatory agency, a frequent target for congressional Republicans and pro-industry groups. Attorneys general for at least 15 states say they plan to sue over the new carbon restrictions, and such coal-mining backers as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are urging states to simply ignore new carbon rules from Washington.Over the last week, even Democrats representing states affected by the spill have publicly criticized the agency’s response as anemic. That has forced top administration officials off-message just as they were launching an effort to sell the new carbon rules to the American people.On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy gave a policy speech about the new carbon-reduction program at an event in Washington. But at a news conference afterward, every question was about the mine spill. McCarthy said her agency takes full responsibility for the accident and expressed deep sorrow for the environmental harm caused to the Animas and San Juan rivers. After bipartisan pressure from the congressional delegations of Colorado and New Mexico, the EPA chief departed Washington for a two-day fence-mending trip out West to show that her agency is responsive.For Republicans, it was an opportunity to put the EPA on the defensive. “I think we have seen what happens when the EPA comes after private industry — they come after them with heavy hand, ” said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.  “Now, the shoe is on the other foot, and we have seen a lack of communication and coordination. ... This goes to the core competency of the EPA. ”For Republicans, it was an opportunity to put the EPA on the defensive. “I think we have seen what happens when the EPA comes after private industry — they come after them with heavy hand, ” said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.  “Now, the shoe is on the other foot, and we have seen a lack of communication and coordination. ... This goes to the core competency of the EPA. ”Bob Deans, a spokesman for the environmental group National Resources Defense Council, predicted that people would see efforts to link the spill to regulations aimed at addressing climate change for what it is — political theater. “The public wants action on climate change and we expect our waters, to be protected from mining waste, ” he said.  “We count on the EPA to do both. This tragic accident hasn’t changed that. If anything, it’s highlighted the risks we take and the price we pay when we allow environmental threats to fester. ”Still, the EPA’s handling of the Gold King spill is likely to remain an issue of political debate. “Now that his EPA has accepted full responsibility, I expect President Obama to demand full accountability for what happened here, ” said House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The effort by a coalition of environmental groups is the latest chapter in a fight that has ebbed and flowed over decades about how to handle PCBs discharged into the river by General Electric Co. They argue the river won't be truly clean unless dredge crews return, while Environmental Protection Agency focuses on the progress made along the 40-mile stretch of river north of Albany. "The question is: Was the job a big enough one, or should it have been bigger? " said EPA regional Superfund director Walter Mugdan.  "I don't have any evidence at this moment to suggest anything other than that this is a success. " Mugdan added that the sampling of river sediment, water and fish in the coming months under a review performed every five years will provide more information on how effective dredging was.Until the mid '70s, GE plants discharged into the river more than 1 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls, which are considered a probable carcinogen. A 200-mile stretch of river down to New York City became a Superfund site in 1984. But the EPA didn't call for dredging until 2002, after years of dispute over whether it would be effective.GE last year finished removing 2.75 million cubic yards of contaminated sediment as part of a 2006 legal agreement with the EPA, which the agency has estimated cost GE about $1.5 billion. Calls to dredge beyond the agreed-to areas grew louder before barges left the river.Advocates cite an analysis that concluded the river will take far longer to recover due to greater PCB contamination than initially expected. They say EPA should call for more dredging under provisions in the legal settlement that gives the agency that right if new information shows the cleanup is failing to protect human health and the environment. "We think the Obama administration has responsibility to position this for appropriate action before it leaves office, " said Ned Sullivan, president of Scenic Hudson, part of a coalition seeking expanded dredging.There are no signs it will happen any time soon.GE maintains that it continues to fulfill all of its obligations. Company spokesman Mark Behan said in an email that  "GE removed the majority of PCBs from the Upper Hudson -- more than 300,000 pounds and more than twice as much as had been anticipated. " The EPA's Mugdan questions the analysis critics use to claim more dredging is needed. He said it's important to look at the proportional reduction in PCBs that Hudson River fish are exposed to and adds that portions of the river bottom with the highest PCB concentrations have basically been eliminated.Sullivan believes information gathered from a thorough five-year review could provide more information pointing to the need for more dredging. Mugdan said it might take eight years before scientists could draw conclusions from annual fish samples.The EPA in December agreed to speed up the timeline for its five-year review. There is an April 2017 deadline, though it remains unclear how long it will take.Meanwhile, GE is dismantling the sprawling plant used to process contaminated sediment dredged from the river. The EPA green-lighted the dismantling last fall, despite pleas from advocates and project trustees.Those trustees from other government agencies are assessing the total harm done to the river's resources, which could lead to either a settlement with GE over the company's liability or to litigation.GE crews will return to the river around May to restore areas where they worked. Divers will introduce thousands of underwater plants to dredged areas.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("RENO, Nev. (AP) — Fifteen years after U.S. regulators started assessing damage and health risks at an abandoned Nevada copper mine, the Environmental Protection Agency is moving to designate the contaminated land a Superfund site, a step the state could still oppose.Rural neighbors of the World War II-era mine that has leaked toxic chemicals for decades won a $19.5 million settlement in 2013 from companies they accused of covering up the contamination to drinking water wells near Yerington, about 65 miles southeast of Reno.The EPA sent a letter to Gov. Brian Sandoval this week announcing its intention to place the mine on the list of the nation’s most polluted sites to  “mitigate exposures that are a substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment. ” “If we do not receive a written response from the state by Jan. 29, we will assume that Nevada is in agreement with EPA and will proceed with proposing the site for addition to the NPL,” Jared Blumenfeld, the agency’s regional administrator in San Francisco, wrote in a Dec. 22 letter obtained by The Associated Press. NPL is the acronym for the Superfund’s National Priority List. Aides to Sandoval had no immediate comment. Nevada has opposed past EPA proposals to list the site, fearing an effect on property values and any precedent that could be set by federal intervention in the mining-friendly state, the world’s sixth-biggest producer of gold.But Nevada regulators estimated earlier this year that it would cost $30.4 million to address only what the EPA considers the most immediate health and safety concerns, and the state has been unsuccessful in obtaining financial assistance from those responsible for the damage.Under the Superfund listing, the EPA would cover 90 percent of the costs. “Without an identifiable private source of funding, the only mechanism to make federal funding available is to add the site to the NPL, ” Blumenfeld said.It comes after residents filed a class-action lawsuit in 2011 accusing Atlantic Richfield Co. and parent company BP America Inc. of  “intentionally and negligently ” concealing the extent of uranium, arsenic and other pollutants leaking into their drinking water wells from the mine.The mine covers 6 square miles of land owned partly by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Atlantic Richfield acquired the property in 1977 from Anaconda Copper, which built the mine in 1941. Previous owners left behind 90 million gallons of acidic solution that continues to threaten the groundwater, Blumenfeld said. That’s equivalent to the amount of liquid it would take to cover about 80 football fields, 10 feet deep.In 2008, a U.S. Labor Department review panel upheld a whistleblower claim by ex-mine cleanup supervisor Earle Dixon who said the BLM illegally fired him for speaking out about the risks in defiance of local politicians.Peggy Pauly, a Yerington minister’s wife, helped organize efforts to demand additional cleanup and filed the lawsuit, joined by about 700 past and present neighbors.Steven German, a New York-based attorney who represented the residents, called her  “the real hero in all of this. ” “This is an important next step in getting this massive old mine cleaned up, ” he said Wednesday of the listing.  “It is going to cost a fortune. ”Anaconda, the former owner, produced 1.7 billion pounds of copper from 1952 to 1978 at the mine in the Mason Valley, an irrigated agricultural oasis in the otherwise largely barren high desert.The EPA determined that the uranium was produced as a byproduct of processing the copper and that the radioactive waste was initially dumped into dirt-bottomed ponds that leaked into the groundwater.Federal studies showed 79 percent of the wells tested north of the mine had dangerous levels of uranium, arsenic or both that made the water unsafe to drink, including one a half-mile away with levels more than 10 times the legal drinking water standard.At the mine itself, wells tested as high as 100 times the standard. Although the health effects of specific levels are not well-understood, long-term exposure to high levels of uranium in drinking water may cause cancer and damage kidneys, the EPA said.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("PARIS -- This time, it's a hotter, waterier, wilder Earth that world leaders are trying to save.The last time that the nations of the world struck a binding agreement to fight global warming was 1997, in Kyoto, Japan. As leaders gather for a conference in Paris on Monday to try to do more, it's clear things have changed dramatically over the past 18 years.Some differences can be measured: degrees on a thermometer, trillions of tons of melting ice, a rise in sea level of a couple of inches. Epic weather disasters, including punishing droughts, killer heat waves and monster storms, have plagued Earth.As a result, climate change is seen as a more urgent and concrete problem than it was last time. "At the time of Kyoto, if someone talked about climate change, they were talking about something that was abstract in the future, " said Marcia McNutt, the former U.S. Geological Survey director who was picked to run the National Academies of Sciences.  "Now, we're talking about changing climate, something that's happening now. You can point to event after event that is happening in the here and now that is a direct result of changing climate. " Other, nonphysical changes since 1997 have made many experts more optimistic than in previous climate negotiations.For one, improved technology is pointing to the possibility of a world weaned from fossil fuels, which emit heat-trapping gases. Businesses and countries are more serious about doing something, in the face of evidence that some of science's worst-case scenarios are coming to pass. "I am quite stunned by how much the Earth has changed since 1997, " Princeton University's Bill Anderegg said in an email.  "In many cases (e.g. Arctic sea ice loss, forest die-off due to drought), the speed of climate change is proceeding even faster than we thought it would two decades ago. "Eighteen years ago, the discussion was far more about average temperatures, not the freakish extremes. Now, scientists and others realize it is in the more frequent extremes that people are truly experiencing climate change.Witness the  "large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires, " former Vice President Al Gore, who helped negotiate the 1997 agreement, told The Associated Press.  "There's a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally right now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. "Studies have shown that man-made climate change contributed in a number of recent weather disasters. Among those that climate scientists highlight as most significant: the 2003 European heat wave that killed 70,000 people in the deadliest such disaster in a century; Hurricane Sandy, worsened by sea level rise, which caused more than $67 billion in damage and claimed 159 lives; the 2010 Russian heat wave that left more than 55,000 dead; the drought still gripping California; and Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 6,000 in the Philippines in 2013.Still,  "while the Earth is a lot more dangerous on one side, the technologies are a lot better than they were, " said Jeffrey Sachs, director of Columbia University's Earth Institute. Solar and wind have come down tremendously in price, so much so that a Texas utility gives away wind-generated electricity at night.Another big change is China.In Kyoto, China and developing countries weren't required to cut emissions. Global warming was seen as a problem for the U.S. and other rich nations to solve. But now China -- by far the world's No. 1 carbon polluter -- has reached agreement with the U.S. to slow emissions and has become a leader in solar power. "The negotiations are no longer defined by rich and poor, " Gore said.  "There's a range of countries in the middle, emerging economies, and thankfully some of them have stepped up to shoulder some of the responsibility. "U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said there's far less foot-dragging in negotiations:  "There is not a single country that tells me they don't want a good Paris agreement. "Figueres said that while the Kyoto agreement dictated to individual nations how much they must cut, what comes out of Paris will be based on what the more than 150 countries say they can do. That tends to work better, she said.It has to, Figueres said.  "The urgency is much clearer now than it used to be. "","IshaCSVtest.csv")

The declaration was requested Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who had also sought a major disaster declaration and asked for nearly $96 million to be expedited for relief efforts. A disaster declaration would have freed up more federal aid, but Flint’s problem did not qualify because it was a disaster caused by humans.

newsTextToCSV("NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- BP acted  "recklessly " and bears most of the responsibility for the nation's worst offshore oil spill, a federal judge concluded Thursday, exposing the energy giant to roughly $18 billion in additional penalties.BP's market value plummeted by $7 billion after the ruling as its shares suffered their worst percentage decline in almost three years. By Thursday afternoon, company shares had fallen almost 6 percent to $45.05.BP PLC, which vowed to appeal, already agreed to pay billions in criminal fines and compensation to people and businesses affected by the disaster. U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier's ruling that BP acted with  "gross negligence " deals instead with civil responsibilities, and could nearly quadruple what the London-based company has to pay in fines for polluting the Gulf of Mexico. The judge held a non-jury trial last year to apportion blame for the Macondo well spill, which killed 11 men on the Deepwater Horizon rig and spewed oil for 87 days in 2010.He ruled that BP bears 67 percent of the blame, Swiss-based drilling rig owner Transocean Ltd. bears 30 percent, and Houston-based cement contractor Halliburton Energy Services is responsible for 3 percent.BP made  "profit-driven decisions " during the drilling that led to the deadly blowout, the judge concluded in his 153-page ruling.  "These instances of negligence, taken together, evince an extreme deviation from the standard of care and a conscious disregard of known risks, " he wrote.BP said it would appeal.  "An impartial view of the record does not support the erroneous conclusion reached by the District Court, " its statement said.Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said  "we're pleased with the court's finding that BP acted with gross negligence and willful misconduct. "The ruling exposes BP to about $18 billion in civil fines under the Clean Water Act. It also  "repudiates BP's claims that it was merely negligent and will further damage BP's already badly damaged reputation, " said David Uhlmann, a University of Michigan law professor and former chief of the Justice Department's environmental crimes section.James Roy and Stephen Herman, who represented oil spill victims in the trial, said  "we hope that today's judgment will bring some measure of closure to the families of the eleven men who tragically lost their lives, and to the thousands of people and businesses still trying to recover from the spill. " Barbier wrote that legal precedents prevent him adding punitive damages that would have been appropriate given the  "egregious " conduct of BP's employees.The judge cited a botched safety test that should have warned the rig's drilling crew that the well was in danger of blowing out. Barbier said BP ultimately was responsible for misinterpreting the  "negative pressure test. "Donald Vidrine, one of BP's well site leaders on the rig, should have known that the negative test had failed based on abnormal pressure readings before the blowout, Barbier wrote.Vidrine and another BP rig supervisor, Robert Kaluza, await trial on federal manslaughter charges for the workers' deaths, in the same New Orleans courthouse where Barbier sits.The judge was assigned to oversee most of the federal litigation spawned by BP's spill. Last year, he presided over two phases of a trial for claims against BP and its contractors brought by the federal government, the five Gulf states and private lawyers representing businesses and residents.Barbier heard eight weeks of testimony before identifying the causes of the blowout of BP's Macondo well and assigning percentages of fault to the companies involved in the drilling project. The second phase took three weeks, focusing on dueling estimates of how much oil spilled and examining BP's efforts to seal the well.Government experts estimated that 4.2 million barrels, or 176 million gallons, spilled into the Gulf. BP urged the judge to use an estimate of 2.45 million barrels, or nearly 103 million gallons, in calculating any Clean Water Act penalties. Both sides agreed that 810,000 barrels, or 34 million gallons, was captured before it could cause pollution. Barbier hasn't ruled yet on the question of how much oil spilled into the Gulf.Millions of gallons of crude gushed from the sea floor after the well blew and triggered a rig explosion, killing wildlife, staining beaches and polluting marshes. BP ultimately sealed the well after several techniques failed to stop the gusher.BP says it has spent more than $24 billion in spill-related expenses to date, including cleanup costs as well as payments to affected businesses and residents. Long before Thursday's ruling, the company estimated that its total payout to fully resolve its spill-related liability would be $42 billion.BP pleaded guilty in January 2013 to manslaughter in the rig workers' deaths. BP also agreed to pay a record $4 billion in penalties as part of its deal with the Justice Department, but the plea agreement didn't resolve the federal government's civil claims.Under the Clean Water Act, a polluter can be forced to pay a maximum of either $1,100 or $4,300 per barrel of spilled oil. The higher limit applies if the company is found grossly negligent -- as BP was in Barbier's ruling. But penalties can be assessed at amounts below these caps.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("DETROIT -- One lawsuit seeks to replace lead-leaching water lines at no cost to customers. Another seeks money for thousands of Flint residents who unwittingly drank toxic water. A third complaint has been filed on behalf of people with Legionnaires' disease.While government officials scramble to rid Flint's tap water of lead, victims are suing Gov. Rick Snyder, the former mayor, rank-and-file public employees and almost anyone else who may have had a role in supplying the troubled city with corrosive river water for 18 months.he lawsuits accuse them of violating civil rights, wrecking property values and enriching themselves by selling a contaminated product.
" How can they look at themselves in the mirror? " asked New York attorney Hunter Shkolnik, who filed the latest lawsuit Monday on behalf of 2-year-old Sophia Waid.  "It's an embarrassment for government officials to take the safety of their citizens so lightly. " Sophia's father, Luke Waid, said he feared losing custody of his daughter when blood tests revealed that she had elevated levels of lead. Those tests were done long before Flint's tap water was identified as the culprit in 2015.Lead affects the central nervous system, especially in children aged 6 and younger, and can cause learning problems and hyperactivity. "She's constantly on edge, " Waid said of his daughter.  "It's almost like she's suffering some kind of anxiety. "His lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified financial award, is one of at least seven complaints involving Flint in state and federal courts. It's the first by Shkolnik and Detroit co-counsel Brian McKeen, but the lawyers plan more. Separately, 1,700 households have contacted Michael Pitt's Detroit-area firm about joining the class-action case he filed in November.The city's supply was switched from Detroit water to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014, when Flint was under state-appointed emergency management. While key facts are undisputed -- the untreated river water caused lead to leach from old pipes -- these cases still are no slam-dunk for lawyers specializing in personal injury.State government has defenses, especially a long-recognized cloak of immunity in certain lawsuits, said Chris Hastings, who teaches at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. "Defense lawyers aren't going to come in and say these cases don't have any merit based on the facts, " Hastings said.  "They're going to come in with narrow, technical defenses that exist regardless of those issues. Courts are good at setting the emotions aside and looking at the law. That's probably the best angle, " Hastings said.  "But it's likely, with the wide net that's cast, that a number of defendants will still have a 'we-didn't-do-it' defense. "No substantial responses have been filed. In one lawsuit, a federal judge has granted a request from the attorney general's office to give Snyder and state employees more time to explore legal defenses.Snyder spokesman Dave Murray declined to comment, saying it would be inappropriate for the governor's office to discuss pending litigation.In 2013, a judge rejected a class-action lawsuit in the District of Columbia on behalf of children who may have been exposed to lead in water in Washington. The lawsuit said the D.C. Water and Sewer Authority hid elevated lead levels from customers and federal authorities between 2001 and 2004, and failed to take steps to remedy the situation.The complaint followed a study by Children's National Medical Center and Virginia Tech that determined hundreds of children were at risk of health and development problems linked to lead.Virginia Tech is also involved in studies of Flint water.Separately, attorney Geoffrey Fieger is suing a hospital and various public officials over Legionnaires' disease, not lead. Genesee County had an extraordinary spike in cases of the waterborne lung disease while Flint was relying on the Flint River for its water supply -- at least 87 confirmed illnesses, including nine deaths.  "The more I read and learn about this, the angrier I get. ... I can no longer stand on the sidelines and watch this debacle unfold, " said Fieger, who is representing three people who survived pneumonia and the family of a fourth who died.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("DENVER — Beneath the western United States lie thousands of old mining tunnels filled with the same toxic stew that spilled into a Colorado river last week, turning it into a nauseating yellow concoction and stoking alarm about contamination of drinking water.Though the spill into the Animas River in southern Colorado is unusual for its size, it’s only the latest instance of the region grappling with the legacy of a centuries-old mining boom that helped populate the region but also left buried toxins.Until the late 1970s there were no regulations on mining in most of the region, meaning anyone could dig a hole where they liked and search for gold, silver, copper or zinc. Abandoned mines fill up with groundwater and snowmelt that becomes tainted with acids and heavy metals from mining veins which can trickle into the region’s waterways. Experts estimate there are 55,000 such abandoned mines from Colorado to California, and federal and state authorities have struggled to clean them for decades. The federal government says 40 percent of the headwaters of Western waterways have been contaminated from mine runoff. Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency was trying to staunch leakage from a gold mine — not worked since 1923 — high in the San Juan Mountains of southern Colorado. But workers moving debris from the mine tunnel accidentally opened up the passage, leading to 3 million gallons of sludge spilling into a creek that carried it into the Animas River. From there the discharge headed toward the Colorado River, which provides water to tens of millions of Westerners. “The whole acid draining issue is something we struggle with in the western United States, ” said Bruce Stover, the Colorado Department of Mining official in charge of dealing with abandoned mines in that state. But the Wednesday spill from the Gold King mine shows the amount of damage that the slightest cleanup accident can inflict. The mine is one of four outside the old mining town of Silverton that have leaked heavy metals into Cement Creek, which flows into the Animas. Cement Creek is so poisoned that no fish live there and the EPA has long registered abnormal levels of acidity and heavy metals in the upper Animas that have also injured aquatic life. Downstream, though, the Animas flows through the scenic town of Durango and is a magnet for summer vacationers, fishermen and rafters. The river turned yellow Thursday, emitting a sickening stench and sending water agencies scrambling to shut off the taps from the waterway.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("FARMINGTON, N.M. — A yellow sludge spilling from a shuttered gold mine into a southwestern Colorado river has reached northern New Mexico, a state official said Saturday.The plume arrived in the city of Aztec on Friday night and Farmington on Saturday morning, San Juan County Emergency Management Director Don Cooper said.Officials in both cities shut down the river’s access to water treatment plants and say the communities have a 90-day supply of water and other water sources to draw from. “There’s not a lot we can do. We can keep people away (from the river) and keep testing, ” Cooper said.  “We still don’t know how bad it is. ” About 1 million gallons of wastewater from Colorado’s Gold King Mine began spilling into the Animas River on Wednesday when a cleanup crew supervised by the Environmental Protection Agency accidentally breached a debris dam that had formed inside the mine. The mine has been inactive since 1923. Federal officials say the spill contains heavy metals including lead and arsenic, and tests were being analyzed. The spilled water also contained cadmium, aluminum, copper and calcium, but the concentrations were not immediately known.The Animas flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico, and the San Juan flows into Utah, where it joins the Colorado River in Lake Powell.The EPA warned people to stay out of the river and to keep domestic animals from drinking from it. Local officials declared stretches of the river off-limits in Colorado and New Mexico.At least two of the heavy metals found in the waste water can be lethal for humans with long-term exposure. Arsenic at high levels can cause blindness, paralysis and cancer. Lead poisoning can create muscle and vision problems for adults, harm development in fetuses and lead to kidney disease, developmental problems and sometimes death in children, the EPA said.Water continues to spill from the mine at a rate of about 700 gallons per minute, Joan Card, an adviser to EPA Regional Director Shaun McGrath, said Saturday. Crews were building containment ponds to catch and treat the water.Officials said the contamination would likely settle into sediment in Lake Powell. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area officials said visitors will be warned starting Monday to avoid drinking, swimming or boating on affected stretches of the lake and river until further notice. The spill from the mine flowed down Cement Creek and into the scenic Animas River.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("BILLINGS, Mont. — Site investigations and some cleanup work at 10 polluted mining complexes in four states were suspended because of conditions similar to those that led to a huge wastewater blowout from an inactive Colorado gold mine, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency officials said.The sites include three in California, four in Colorado, two in Montana and one in Missouri, according to details obtained by the Associated Press.They have the potential for contaminated water to build up inside mine workings, EPA Assistant Administrator Mathy Stanislaus said. That would set the stage for a possible spill such as last month’s near Silverton, Colo., where an EPA team triggered a 3 million gallon blowout of toxic sludge while doing excavation work on the inactive Gold King Mine. The accident fouled rivers in three states and attracted harsh criticism of the EPA for not being prepared despite warnings that such a spill could happen. “We want to take extra caution before we initiate any work, ” Stanislaus said of the work suspensions. Some the mines were abandoned decades ago and have grown more unstable over time, raising the risk of an accident.The stop-work order was issued last month but officials for weeks refused to disclose specifics.Cleanup efforts on some of the mines have been going on for years yet remain unfinished, underscoring the complexity of a long-running attempt to address an estimated 500,000 abandoned mines across the U.S. Work on others was in the early stages.In a report to Congress delivered Friday, the Government Accountability Office said federal agencies identified thousands of contaminated mine sites in recent years — even as their attempts to assess what harm is being done to people and the environment have lagged.Further investigations were needed to gauge the danger posed by the 10 mining complexes under the suspension before work could safely resume, according to EPA documents.The Aug. 12 stop-work order from EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy did not apply to sites where halting operations would pose a threat to people or increase the potential for harm to the environment, according to EPA documents.Also exempted were portions of the 10 stopped projects where construction already was completed, such as treatment systems for contaminated water that pours from many abandoned mine shafts.That’s the case for two sites in northern California — the Leviathan sulfur mine near Markleeville (Alpine County) and the Iron Mountain metals mine near Redding. Water continues to be collected at the sites, to be treated and then discharged.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("GOLETA, Calif. >> The operator of an oil pipeline that broke and spilled thousands of gallons of crude across a scenic California shoreline says it could take weeks or even months before investigators find what caused the disaster.
Bad weather slowed cleanup efforts early Friday at the spill site in Santa Barbara County, where gusty winds whipped up waves as high as 4 feet, the National Weather Service said. Several days of calm seas had helped crews, but oil skimming vessels were brought in late Thursday, Santa Barbara news station KEYT-TV reported.
An estimated 105,000 gallons of crude spilled Tuesday, and about 21,000 gallons is believed to have made it to the sea and split into slicks that stretched 9 miles along the coast. As of Thursday, more than 9,000 gallons had been raked, skimmed and vacuumed up, officials said.The thick, powerful-smelling crude covered rocks and sand, and six oil-coated pelicans and one juvenile sea lion had been rescued.

Crews have yet to excavate the broken piece of pipeline, which under the law must be done in the presence of federal regulators and a third party, officials with Plains All American Pipeline LP said at a Thursday news conference.
“We have not even uncovered the pipe yet,” said Patrick Hodgins, the company’s senior director of safety.
The company would not yet say whether part of the cause was two malfunctions that occurred shortly before the spill was discovered.
“We were having some pump problems on the pipeline,” said Rick McMichael, another Plains All American representative. “Whether it led to the leak or not is part of our investigation.”
The 24-inch pipe, built in 1987, had no previous problems and was thoroughly inspected in 2012, according to the company. The pipe underwent similar tests about two weeks ago, though the results had not been analyzed yet.
After the spill, which closed a 23-by-7-mile area to fishing, many volunteers offered to help sop up oil and clean off animals, but they were being turned away and encouraged not to act on their own.
“We just don’t have enough positions,” U.S. Coast Guard Capt. Jennifer Williams said.
The latest spill is a drop in the bucket compared with a catastrophic blowout on the same stretch of coast in 1969, when a Union Oil platform blew out and spewed an estimated 3 million gallons of crude along 30 miles of coast. Some 9,000 birds died, new regulations were passed and a new era of environmental activism began in the U.S. Nevertheless, the new spill is being held up as another reason to oppose such things as fracking, the Keystone XL pipeline that would run from Canada to Texas, the moving of crude by train, and drilling in far-flung places.
“What we see from this event is that the industry still poses enormous risks to an area we cannot afford to lose,” said Joel Reynolds of the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Plains All American and its subsidiaries operate more than 6,000 miles of hazardous liquid pipelines in at least 20 states, according to company reports. Those companies handle more than 4 million barrels of crude and other liquid fuels daily.
Since 2006, the companies have reported 199 accidents and been subject to 22 enforcement actions by federal regulators. The accidents resulted in a combined 725,500 gallons of hazardous liquids spilled and damage topping $25 million.
Corrosion was determined to be the cause in more than 80 of those accidents. Failures in materials, welds and other equipment were cited more than 70 times.
Enforcement cases against the companies resulted in the collection of $154,000 in penalties, according to a federal database.
Hodgins, of Plains All American, said the company has spent more than $1.3 billion since 2007 on maintenance, repair and enhancement of its equipment.
He also defended the company’s safety record, saying accidental releases have decreased as the number of miles of pipelines has increased.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. >> Townspeople affected by the millions of gallons of toxic waste spilled from an abandoned gold mine and now flowing through their communities demanded clarity Tuesday about any long-term threats to their water supply.Colorado and New Mexico made disaster declarations for stretches of the Animas and San Juan rivers and the Navajo Nation declared an emergency as the waste spread downstream, reaching Lake Powell in Utah sometime this week.EPA workers accidentally unleashed an estimated 3 million gallons of orange-yellow waste, including high concentrations of arsenic, lead and other heavy metals, while inspecting the long-abandoned Gold King mine near Silverton, Colorado, on Aug. 5.EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Tuesday in Washington, D.C., that she takes full responsibility for the spill, which she said “pains me to no end.” She said the agency is working around the clock to assess the environmental impact. EPA officials said the shockingly bright plume has already dissipated and that the leading edge of the contamination cannot be seen in the downstream stretches of the San Juan River or Lake Powell.So far, the Bureau of Reclamation has no plans to slow flows on the lower Colorado River, below Lake Powell, where the water is a vital resource for parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.Chris Watt, a bureau spokesman in Salt Lake City, said his agency is testing the water at the request of the EPA, and can’t discuss the impact without learning the results.None of this has eased concerns or quelled anger among people in the arid Southwest who depend on this water for their survival.The Navajos, whose nation covers parts of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, shut down water intake systems and stopped diverting water from the San Juan River. Frustrated tribal council members echoed state officials, insisting that the federal government pay for its mistakes.“At this point, how long are we going to continue to truck in water? Who’s going to pick up the tab? Are we going to hold these people accountable? I want answers from the EPA, but they’re nowhere to be found,” said David Filfred, a Navajo Nation council delegate. “This is a lifeline. This is our culture. This is who we are.” Heavy metals from Gold King and other defunct mines in Colorado have been leaching out and killing fish and other species for decades as rain and snowmelt spills from mining operations left abandoned and exposed. The EPA has considered making part of the Animas River in Colorado a Superfund site for a quarter-century.It would have provided more resources for a cleanup, but some in Colorado opposed Superfund status, fearing the stigma and the federal strings attached, so the EPA agreed to allow local officials to lead cleanup efforts instead.Now the Attorneys General of Utah, New Mexico and Colorado are coordinating a response to ensure “whatever remediation is necessary occurs as quickly as possible,” Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said in a statement.Utah Gov. Gary Herbert expressed disappointment with the EPA’s initial handling of the spill, but said the state has no plans for legal action. New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, however, said she would not take anything off the table and that the EPA should be held to the same standards as industry.“Right now we have people preparing for a lawsuit if that is what we need to do,” she said Tuesday.Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper spent Tuesday visiting a contaminated stretch of river.The EPA has said the current flows too fast for the contaminants to pose an immediate health threat, and that the heavy metals will likely be diluted over time so that they don’t pose a longer-term threat, either.Still, as a precautionary measure, the agency said stretches of the rivers would be closed for drinking water, recreation and other uses at least through Aug. 17.Dissolved iron is what turned the waste plume an alarming orange-yellow, a color familiar to old-time miners who call it “yellow boy.”“The water appears worse aesthetically than it actually is, in terms of health,” said Ron Cohen, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the Colorado School of Mines.Tests show some of the metals have settled to the bottom and would dissolve only if conditions became acidic, which Cohen said isn’t likely. He advises leaving the metals where they settle, and counting on next spring’s mountain snowmelt to dilute them more and flush them downstream.No die-off of wildlife along the river has been detected. Federal officials say all but one of a test batch of fingerling trout deliberately exposed to the water survived over the weekend.As a precaution, state and federal officials ordered public water systems to turn off intake valves as the plume passes. Boaters and fishing groups have been told to avoid affected stretches of the Animas and San Juan rivers, which are usually crowded with rafters and anglers in a normal summer.Farmers also have been forced to stop irrigating, endangering their crops, and recreational businesses report losing thousands of dollars.“We had lots of trips booked. Right now we’re just canceling by the day,” said Drew Beezley, co-owner of 4 Corners Whitewater in Durango, Colorado. He said his dozen employees are out of work, and he’s lost about $10,000 in business since the spill.“We don’t really know what the future holds yet,” said Beezley. “We don’t know if the rest of this season is just scrapped.” ","IshaCSVtest.csv")v

newsTextToCSV("Approximately 100 barrels of oil bubbled up from an underground "carrier" pipeline located some 300 feet from the creek and about 3 miles upstream from where the creek crosses underneath FM 1314. The 12-inch diameter pipeline transports the unrefined crude produced from the long-standing oil field east of Conroe to a "central battery" facility in the city before the oil is shipped to refineries.According to several sources, the leak was discovered before 7 a.m. Thursday morning. Environmental crews were on the scene by 9 a.m. to commence cleanup, said Ronnie Kelley, Texas operations manager for SemPipe LP, the Oklahoma-based firm that owns and operates the pipelines located within the oil field and those that lead to the battery facility. Kelley said the leak in the steel pipeline was due to internal corrosion, which is a result of the salt water that is pumped out of the ground along with the crude oil. There are about 100 working oil wells in the field now owned by Wapiti Energy LLC. The Houston firm purchased the 20,000-acre field and the battery facility from ExxonMobil last August. Emergency and haz-mat crews could be seen at the creek bridge on Koalstad Road, at the bridge on FM 1314 and upstream from Texas 242.Oil in the creek was discovered between 5-5:15 a.m. at the FM 1314 bridge, said Philip Moore, Montgomery County Health Department assistant director of solid waste and nuisance abatement."We think the leak actually happened between Koalstad and Texaco Road," Moore said.Oil booms were placed throughout the creek, while two 40,000-gallon tanker trucks vacuumed up the oil north of the Koalstad bridge, Moore said. About 100 yards upstream from the FM 1314 bridge, levees were created to slow down the water flow to make it possible to siphon the oil, Moore said, adding the leak was plugged around 11 a.m.The early morning rains, believed to be about 4 inches in that area of Crystal Creek, created the heavy water flow and made it difficult to place booms and catch oil riding on top of the stream. But for any oil that escaped the several clean up points, the strong moving water was also a positive because it helped disperse any residual oil, Moore said.If motorists couldn't see the thick, black stream flowing through 4-1/2 miles of Crystal Creek Thursday, they got a whiff of its fumes as they opened their windows to see what all the commotion was about. Those in cars were able to drive away from the nauseating stench, but residents along Crystal Creek were stuck.Frances McKandles' daughter-in-law told her the odor was horrible, but McKandles was spared the fumes since she had a cold. She initially thought someone fell off the bridge because of all the emergency vehicles at the FM 1314 bridge, McKandles, who lives about one block south of the creek on Koalstad Road, said."It sure does not make me happy that they are polluting our water," McKandles said.Arthur Humble lives upwind from the creek, about one block from where haz-mat crews were working, he said."My wife took the cat to the vet and said she though it was a wreck on FM 1314," Humble said.But when television news helicopters started circling overhead, he knew it was something else. However, since his home was upwind from the spill, he was spared from the vapors."I'm lucky today, because I can't smell it," Humble said, adding that wasn't the case with an oil spill a few years ago in the area.Kelley said cleanup crews from Gardner Environmental, Oil Mop Inc. and Cen-Tex Pipeline were able to contain the spill before any of the crude oil traveled downstream and reached the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. As vacuum trucks removed the accumulated crude throughout the day Thursday, he estimated the cleanup would take 48 hours."We've begun a washing operation to get rid of an accumulated crude oil," Kelley said. "We want to be in business where we don't make messes. I don't want to do things that risk the environment."Bart Agee, senior vice president of Wapiti, said the Conroe field produces about 2,000 gallons of crude oil and 1.5 million cubic feet of natural gas daily."Our operators supervise that field 24 hours a day," Agee said. "One of our operators discovered that leak (Thursday) morning and we immediately shut down our production and began our haz-mat procedures. We're going to do the prudent thing and protect the community first."Although Kelley said the pipeline that broke down Thursday was on a completely separate system, it was in the same vicinity as the crude oil spill that occurred in May 2005 in an isolated stretch of the creek between Johnson and Koalstad roads. Nearly 90 gallons of crude spewed into Crystal Creek during that first incident, but the spill was contained at the FM 1314 bridge.It is estimated Thursday's leak occurred about a mile upstream from where the 8-inch diameter pipeline burst in 2005, also from internal corrosion."The spill back then had nothing to do with this one, even though the cause was the same," Kelley said.According to Kelley's records, Exxon installed the 12-inch carrier pipeline in 1974.The Texas Railroad Commission has jurisdiction over all spills involving crude oil pipelines. Because the spill was in excess of 25 barrels, SemPipe is required to submit soil and water samples that the impacted area has been properly remediated.Ramona Nye, spokeswoman for the TRC, said her agency had two staff members at the site monitoring the cleanup. In cases like Thursday's, pipeline companies are not penalized when there is an accidental release."We just require them to clean up and remediate the spill," she said. "If they come in compliance, we don't seek enforcement."San Jacinto River Authority General Manager Reed Eichelberger, who also serves as a board member for the Lone Star Groundwater Conservation District, said it's "doubtful" any oil reached the San Jacinto River and made it into the drinking supply."If they were able to contain it there's probably minimal effort on the groundwater," Eichelberger said. "There shouldn't be a threat to the groundwater. It appears they were able to contain it.""Crude oil wouldn't cause as much damage as other chemicals that could have leaked into the creek," Moore said, referring to the numerous pipelines in that area.However, he recommended residents around the creek "exercise caution" for the next 24 to 48 hours and not swim, fish or drink the creek water."We didn't see any sign of fish kill, but that normally doesn't show up for 24-48 hours, if any," Moore said.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Gene Green (D-Texas). "This is a major step forward for the San Jacinto River and its surrounding areas all the way down to the bay."In a July 26 letter to the EPA's regional administrator, Texas Gov. Rick Perry expressed the state's support for the EPA's plan to add the polluted area to the NPL. Texas' approval was necessary before the EPA could proceed with the cleanup process. The EPA created the NPL to designate which sites most urgently need to be cleaned.In September the EPA will publish information about proposed cleanup sites in the Federal Register, accept public comments, and attempt to identify parties responsible for the pollution. Then, the EPA will name sites from around the country to the NPL. The San Jacinto River's waste pits will most likely be included on the list given Texas' cooperation.Green originally became concerned about contamination in the San Jacinto River when he learned that an industrial waste pit used in the 1960s and 1970s was contaminating fish that residents were catching and eating. Pollution levels had been high in the San Jacinto River for many years, but scientists didn't know why until 2005 when they discovered the pit, which is located near the Interstate 10 bridge.According to a February 2007 EPA report, the pit is releasing dangerous levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, commonly called dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, commonly called furans, into the river.In March, Green asked the EPA to add the site to the national Superfund list, which would provide federal money to help clean up the pollution if the parties responsible for the pollution weren't found.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

All life on earth depends on it.Four years ago, the herbicide was linked to endocrine disrupting mutations in frogs.Levels as low as 0.1 parts per billion of Atrazine induced hermaphroditism (characteristics of both sexes).The herbicide, even at extremely low doses, was found to have marked effects on rodents and salmon as well. Experts consider it to be a significant polluter in surface water, groundwater, offshore, and in the atmosphere.Under the Conservation Reserve Program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, atrazine is registered for limited use in rural areas in four states: Oklahoma, Nebraska, Texas, and Oregon.Grazing and cutting grass for hay, where atrazine has been used, is prohibited, except in national emergencies, such as severe drought. Atrazine is also registered for use for lawns, golf courses, and sod farms.According to some arborists, atrazine poisoning in oak trees has sometimes been misdiagnosed as 'Oak Wilt.'Oak Wilt is caused by a fungus that can kill oaks by clogging up their water conduits.It's more often found in the Hill County of Texas.Live Oaks, Shumard Oaks, Water Oaks, Black Jack Oaks, and other varieties of the Red Oak family can be affected by Oak Wilt.Symptoms of Oak Wilt include the tops of the leaf turning brown but the veins of the leaf remaining green. The area between the veins can turn light green to yellow.Eric Putnam is a certified tree arborist who lives in Bacliff, and follows in the footsteps of his father. Putnam runs Arboricultural Technologies Consulting and says he has treated hundreds of oaks in Friendswood with his own organic formula: a "friendly" aerobic bacteria mixed with industrial molasses.Putnam said his unique mixture can catch and reverse atrazine poisoning in its early stages."You have to understand," he said. "There are two kinds of bacteria: aerobic and anaerobic, as well as two kinds of fungus: aerobic and anaerobic. And add to this, an essential ingredient to living organisms is access to oxygen."Upon close examination, says Putnam, oaks that have been poisoned by atrazine look like trees on steroids. Their branches are thick and regimented; there's growth at every single node; and the leaves look like holly leaves, with sharp points at their ends.How does this happen?"Homeowners often don't follow the guidelines in applying atrazine and/or overuse the herbicide," said Putnam.Scott's Weed and Feed, says Putnam, is probably the no. 1 retail fertilizer in the country. Atrazine is its main ingredient.But it's also, according to Putnam, the no. 1 leachable herbicide into our drinking water.Dr. John Jacobs with the Texas Coastal Watershed, agrees."There's atrazine in the Bay. Look, our drinking water comes from upstream," he said. "We certainly don't want the folks in Dallas using atrazine."Don't use chemical treatments, said Jacobs. "Use compost instead. And when you mow, mow high."Jacobs said he never says never. "But with today's variety of organic solutions, you don't have to use chemicals. You can be completely organic. Use organic instead."What's a healthy oak look like?Healthy oaks have randomly occurring branches. The branches are thinner, tend to curve, and have a spring to them. The nodes will show random growth. Leaves characteristically follow an oval shape and are dark green in color."My treatment helps, if the damage is caught in time," says Putnam.He's even used his organic spray on a large oak that got damaged from a swale dug by the City for water drainage."I was called in because the older oak was showing extreme stress from having its roots severed with the digging. I sprayed the entire tree with my organic mix and the grounds around the tree."Six months later, says Putnam, the oak showed significant growth, looks vibrant, and even the confederate rose bush next to it was showing signs of vibrant health."It's an Ever Ready battery, the mix I use. It just keeps on growing and going, so I don't have to come back and treat the area."Putnam says his mixture is like a Pac man. "It hunts down the atrazine in the soil and gobbles it up."Putnam says that when he sprays a tree and the surrounding ground, the formula acts as a protective armor for the tree.That's good, says Jeff Frank, with the New York Horticulture School. Frank runs a two-day "green gorilla" crash course, and has taught 1,400 people in 14 years, including 52 from Texas.Says Frank, "If there's any moisture in the air, the atrazine in the ground will synergize with it."The size of an aspirin of atrazine, says Frank, can kill an acre of land."When it combines with other elements in the air, it becomes much more dangerous."Frank says a great natural weed killer is vinegar. "San Jacinto Environmental in Houston is a great resource for organic plant and soil products."Frank believes that when weeds, insects, and disease are around, "It means there's an imbalance. Every weed is a canary in the coal mine for the homeowner. They're telling the homeowner what's lacking in the soil."Frank says that chemical fertilizers are derived from petroleum distillates and are hard on the soil, pumping salt into an already stressed soil system."We can't just keep putting more and more of this herbicide into an already stressed system and expect different results. That's insanity."Says Putnam, "the atrazine that you put on your grass today, is the atrazine that you are going to drink tomorrow.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("GALVESTON – Contractors dismantling the nuclear barge Sturgis in Galveston  have removed 98 percent of the radioactive material and transported it safely to a disposal site  in West Texas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Tuesday.Workers for Malin International Ship Repair and Drydock were successful in removing most of the radioactive material before the onset of the 2017 hurricane season, which began June 1, said Brenda Barber, project manager for the Corps of Engineers Baltimore District.Fear of radioactive contamination roused opposition in Galveston to having its harbor chosen for the decommissioning of the Sturgis. The city council initially threatened a lawsuit, but backed down on the advice of counsel and environmental experts. Work on dismantling the Sturgis began in 2015 and is in its final stages. Barber said the largest radioactive parts, including the reactor pressure vessel, were removed over the last six weeks.vAbout 850,000 pounds of radioactive waste was transported without incident by rail to a Waste Control Specialists disposal site in Andrews County, about 25 miles north of Midland, Barber said."No evidence of radioactive material, lead or increased radiation exposure from the Sturgis has been documented outside of the reactor containment area to date," she said.About 600,000 pounds of non-radioactive lead has been removed from the vessel and recycled, Barber said.The remaining contaminated items will be removed over the next few months. After all of the radioactive material has been removed, workers will conduct a survey to allow the remaining parts of the Sturgis to be sent to a shipyard and turned into scrap.The Sturgis arrived in Galveston in 2015 after a 2,000-mile journey from Joint Base Langley in Eustis, Va., near Newport News, where it had been mothballed as part of the James River Reserve Fleet since 1976. The Sturgis was originally the World War II Liberty Ship Charles H. Cugle. In 1963, it was chosen to become a nuclear reactor and its propulsion system was ripped out and replaced with a 350-ton containment spheroid.From 1968 to 1976 it provided power to the Panama Canal Zone, then its radioactive fuel was removed and it became part of the reserve fleet.Galveston was one of four possible ports where the corps determined the Sturgis could be scrubbed of its radioactive waste as well as health-threatening asbestos and lead. The agency awarded a $34.66 million contract to Woodlands-based CB&I Federal Services, and the contractor chose Galveston over Baltimore, Hampton Roads, Va.; and Charleston, S.C.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The Brio Superfund site on Dixie Farm Road in southern Harris County is leaking contaminants, a representative with the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed to The Journal Thursday morning.EPA Superfund Remedial Project Manager Gary Miller said the contaminant plume is not a threat to residents, but also said further testing is being done to determine the extent of the contamination.“It’s my understanding that there aren’t any water wells down in that area and our sampling so far has just been on the site,” Miller told The Journal. “But based on that now, we don’t know how far it’s gone. That’s part of the investigation that’s going to be done. Initial indications are that it hadn’t moved very far, very fast.”Miller said initial testing indicated the chemicals found are 1,2-dichloroethane and Vinyl Chloride.“Up until fairly recently, there wasn’t any contamination detected. As a part of the regular monitoring, they started getting detections of those chemicals in the deeper monitoring wells. So what’s been happening out there is a follow-on investigation to try to characterize that and see where it’s going and what it’s doing,” Miller said.The 58-acre Brio site, located at 2501 Dixie Farm and Beamer Road, was declared a federal Superfund site as the result of a $207 million court settlement for a 1992 toxic waste case.The case drew national attention and necessitated the demolition of an adjacent elementary school and the 670-home Southbend subdivision, forcing the relocation of thousands of residents.Brio was operated as an industrial facility from the late 1950s through 1982. During that span the site was used for copper catalyst regeneration, oil blending and refining, and hydrocarbon cracking.The site was also at one time the home of waste disposal plants.Inspections by the EPA during the 1980s indicated that shallow ground water was potentially contaminated with copper, vinyl chloride, fluorene, styrene, and ethylbenzene. In 1984 the EPA detected toluene, benzene, and other chemicals in the air.Residues of contaminants such as xylene, dichloroethene, vinyl chloride and trichloroethane were also detected, factors nearby residents blamed for a number of birth defects and other health problems.“The site, responsible parties or respondents are in the process right now of doing an investigation,” Miller said. “They just recently completed some sampling out there and we got the preliminary results so they’re in the process of preparing a follow-up plan to do some more investigation out there to see how far that plume has moved.”According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1,2-dichloroethane is a manufactured chemical used in the production of vinyl chloride.The chemicals are used to make a variety of plastic and vinyl products including polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes, furniture and automobile upholstery, wall coverings, house wares, and automobile parts. It is also used to as a solvent and is added to leaded gasoline to remove lead.The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has determined that 1,2-dichloroethane may reasonably be expected to cause cancer.The EPA has determined that 1,2-dichloroethane is a probable human carcinogen and the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) considers it to be a possible human carcinogen.Nervous system disorders, liver and kidney diseases, and lung effects have been reported in humans ingesting or inhaling large amounts of 1,2-dichloroethane.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has determined that vinyl chloride is a known carcinogen. Studies in workers who have breathed vinyl chloride over many years showed an increased risk of liver, brain, lung cancer, and some cancers of the blood have also been observed in workers.The ATSDR says the effects of drinking high levels of vinyl chloride are unknown, but if you spill vinyl chloride on your skin, it will cause numbness, redness, and blisters.Miller said that the levels of 1,2-dichloroethane found exceed the MCL drinking water standard.“It initially exceeded the MCL in one well, which is on-site in October of 2007, and it’s been increasing since then,” Miller said. “There were some intermittent samples that were non-detect, so it’s been fluctuating, but overall, it’s been increasing.”According to ATSDR, the EPA allows 0.005 milligrams of 1,2-dichloroethane per liter of drinking water (0.005 mg/L)Vinyl chloride is also regulated in drinking water, food, and air. The EPA requires that the amount of vinyl chloride in drinking water not exceed 0.002 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of water.Miller said fixing the problem depends on how far it’s gone and what the final concentrations are.“It could be an active pump and treat,” he said. “It could be this process we call a monitored natural attenuation, which basically depends on natural processes. Until we get all the data in, it’s really too early to say what the remedy might be.”Superfund was created by Congress in 1980 after widely publicized toxic pollution at Love Canal in New York.The program was designed to provide federal funding for tracking down polluters and holding them financially responsible. If the responsible parties could not pay the site would be cleaned through Superfund resources.The EPA completed the Third Five-Year Review of the Brio site on April 25, 2008.According to EPA documents the review found that the remedy in place at the site is currently protective of human health and the environment.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

It is unsanitary; it's full of bacteria. A lot of people have septic systems that are being inundated with water and pushing contaminated water through the flood plain," Trower said.Brazoria County had ordered the mandatory evacuation of additional areas Tuesday as the city of West Columbia battled rising floodwaters from the Brazos River with sandbags and pumps. A curfew was also put in effect.Sebesta previously had required the evacuation of residents of the Sugar Mills subdivision and Buffalo Camp Farms, and of the area near FM 1642 west of Rosharon and the city of Holiday Lakes.Although no new mandatory evacuations had been issued as of 1 p.m. Wednesday, Trower said that officials were monitoring rising water across the county.Jones Creek, in southern Brazoria county, was one area of concern. She also said that County Road 288 between Lake Jackson and Angleton was seeing alot of water from the Bastrop Bayou nearby.Some 100,000 residents have been affected by the flooding in Brazoria, Trower said.

The landfill’s oily soil piles are located near the Spring and Willow Creeks, but have been covered with vegetation over the years.“The piles of material referred to in this grant application have been present on the property for many years. The piles are covered in vegetation and data suggests the hydrocarbons in the soil are not very mobile, but due to its physical proximity to the creeks, the area could be subject to flooding and erosion,” Hamilton said.If the grant is awarded, the county would need to match 20 percent of the grant, which would be as much as $100,000, she said.The county may pursue a plan to remove the larger pieces of oily waste and some of the contaminated soil from the property.The remaining contaminated soil would be compacted under 2 feet of clay and covered with topsoil before being converted into bike and hike trails as part of an expansion of the Spring Creek Greenway.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("Harris County Attorney Vince Ryan is urging the Environmental Protection Agency to require the complete removal of toxic dioxin wastes at a Superfund site on the San Jacinto River. Waste pits at the site contain a dangerous type of pollutant known as 2,3,7,8-TCDD dioxin, one of the most toxic pollutants in existence making fishing and recreation near the site unsafe. County Attorney Ryan filed comments on behalf of Harris County and its residents in a letter to the EPA. The letter was released to the public Tuesday.In 2008, at the urging of Harris County and others, the site, located in and on the banks of the San Jacinto River near the IH-10 East Bridge in east Harris County, was made a Superfund Site by the EPA. The pits were at one time used to store chemical by-products of paper production. Since that time, by order of the EPA, the responsible parties placed layers of rock and a plastic tarp over the location as a temporary solution to control the leakage. Despite efforts to educate the public of the contamination dangers, including posted warning signs, the area remains a popular place for fishing and family recreation.“The Waste Pits are located in an area of the San Jacinto River that is the locale of boating, swimming, camping, commercial and recreational fishing,” County Attorney Ryan said. “Removal of the source material from the Waste Pits and the river sediment is the only way” to ensure that humans and wildlife are no longer exposed to 2,3,7,8-TCDD.The letter was filed at the invitation of the EPA for consideration by the National Remedy Review Board of the EPA. The Board will meet in July and will recommend to the EPA which remedy to use to clean up the site as well as recommend the amount of dioxin, if any, that can remain after the clean-up. Harris County is recommending complete remediation (the removal of substantially all of the dioxin waste). The EPA will take the recommendations of the Review Board as well as Harris County and the other interested parties into consideration before making a final determination regarding the future of the San Jacinto River waste pits.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

So, the waterway serves as a conduit between those two areas.”A draft of their plan to improve water quality in these watersheds — “The West Fork San Jacinto River and Lake Creek Watershed Protection Plan (WPP)” — was released the week of May 14.Over the next six months, implementation will likely focus on identifying simple, low-cost solutions to reduce pollutants, such as installing pet waste stations in public areas that do not already have them.

EPA officials said the shockingly bright plume has already dissipated and that the leading edge of the contamination cannot be seen in the downstream stretches of the San Juan River or Lake Powell.So far, the Bureau of Reclamation has no plans to slow flows on the lower Colorado River, below Lake Powell, where the water is a vital resource for parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah.Chris Watt, a bureau spokesman in Salt Lake City, said his agency is testing the water at the request of the EPA, and can’t discuss the impact without learning the results.None of this has eased concerns or quelled anger among people in the arid Southwest who depend on this water for their survival.The Navajos, whose sovereign nation covers parts of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona, shut down water intake systems and stopped diverting water from the San Juan River. Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye told The Associated Press that regional EPA officials told him the cleanup could take decades.“Decades. That is totally, completely unsettling,” Begaye said. “This is a huge issue. This river, the San Juan, is our lifeline, not only in a spiritual sense but also it’s an economic base that sustains the people that live along the river. You’re taking away the livelihood and maybe taking it away from them for decades. ... That is just, to me, a disaster of a huge proportion. And we have yet to hear from the Obama administration.” Heavy metals from Gold King and other defunct mines in Colorado have been leaching out and killing fish and other species for decades as rain and snowmelt spills from mining operations left abandoned and exposed.

The company has downplayed the leak’s extent and environmental impact, likening it to scores of minor spills and natural seeps the Gulf routinely absorbs.Yet more than a decade after crude started leaking at the site formerly operated by Taylor Energy Company, few people even know of its existence. The company has downplayed the leak’s extent and environmental impact, likening it to scores of minor spills and natural seeps the Gulf routinely absorbs.An Associated Press investigation has revealed evidence that the spill is far worse than what Taylor — or the government — have publicly reported during their secretive, and costly, effort to halt the leak. Presented with AP’s findings, that the sheen recently averaged about 91 gallons of oil per day across eight square miles, the Coast Guard provided a new leak estimate that is about 20 times greater than one recently touted by the company. Using satellite images and pollution reports, the watchdog group SkyTruth estimates between 300,000 and 1.4 million gallons of oil has spilled from the site since 2004, with an annual average daily leak rate between 37 and 900 gallons. If SkyTruth’s high-end estimate of 1.4 million gallons is accurate, Taylor’s spill would be about 1 percent the size of BP’s, which a judge ruled amounted to 134 million gallons. That would still make the Taylor spill the 8th largest in the Gulf since 1970, according to a list compiled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.“The Taylor leak is just a great example of what I call a dirty little secret in plain sight,” said SkyTruth President John Amos.Taylor has spent tens of millions of dollars to contain and stop its leak, but it says nothing can be done to completely halt the chronic slicks.The New Orleans based company presented federal regulators last year with a proposed “final resolution” at the site, but the details remain under wraps. For years, the government has allowed the company to shield other spill-related information from public scrutiny — all in the name of protecting trade secrets.Industry experts and environmental advocates are baffled by Taylor’s inability to stop the leak and its demands for confidentiality.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

That’s part of the investigation that’s going to be done. Initial indications are that it hadn’t moved very far, very fast.” Miller said initial testing indicated the chemicals found are 1,2-dichloroethane and Vinyl Chloride.“Up until fairly recently, there wasn’t any contamination detected. As a part of the regular monitoring, they started getting detections of those chemicals in the deeper monitoring wells. So what’s been happening out there is a follow-on investigation to try to characterize that and see where it’s going and what it’s doing,” Miller said.The 58-acre Brio site, located at 2501 Dixie Farm and Beamer Road, was declared a federal Superfund site as the result of a $207 million court settlement for a 1992 toxic waste case. Inspections by the EPA during the 1980s indicated that shallow ground water was potentially contaminated with copper, vinyl chloride, fluorene, styrene, and ethylbenzene. In 1984 the EPA detected toluene, benzene, and other chemicals in the air.Residues of contaminants such as xylene, dichloroethene, vinyl chloride and trichloroethane were also detected, factors nearby residents blamed for a number of birth defects and other health problems. According to ATSDR, the EPA allows 0.005 milligrams of 1,2-dichloroethane per liter of drinking water (0.005 mg/L).Vinyl chloride is also regulated in drinking water, food, and air. The EPA requires that the amount of vinyl chloride in drinking water not exceed 0.002 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of water.Miller said fixing the problem depends on how far it’s gone and what the final concentrations are.“It could be an active pump and treat,” he said. “It could be this process we call a monitored natural attenuation, which basically depends on natural processes. Until we get all the data in, it’s really too early to say what the remedy might be.”Superfund was created by Congress in 1980 after widely publicized toxic pollution at Love Canal in New York.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("STOCKHOLM (AP) -- Global mercury emissions could grow by 25 percent by 2020 if no action is taken to control them, posing a threat to polar bears, whales and seals and the Arctic communities who hunt those animals for food, an authoritative international study says.The assessment by a scientific body set up by the eight Arctic rim countries also warns that climate change may worsen the problem, by releasing mercury stored for thousands of years in permafrost or promoting chemical processes that transform the substance into a more toxic form."It is of particular concern that mercury levels are continuing to rise in some Arctic species in large areas of the Arctic," despite emissions reductions in nearby regions like Europe, North America and Russia, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program, or AMAP, said. Traces of mercury are found in almost all fish and shellfish. At certain levels, it can harm the developing nervous system of a fetus or young child if too much tainted seafood is consumed by the mother or child. The World Health Organization says there are higher rates of mental difficulties among children in parts of the world that rely primarily on fish.Inuit communities in the Arctic are at risk because their traditional diet includes seal, whale and to a lesser extent polar bear -- species on top of the food chain that have accumulated high levels of mercury.The AMAP report urged health authorities to communicate these risks to Arctic communities, but was cautious about offering diet recommendations because switching to a Western diet -- and lifestyle -- can lead to other health problems."Because the healthy food choices in local stores are quite expensive, if available at all, it is often more affordable but less nutritious processed foods that are chosen," the report said.Combined with a more "sedentary" Western lifestyle, no longer focused on hunting and fishing, "this new diet increases the risks of developing obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes and coronary heart disease," AMAP said.The report compiles findings from hundreds of published studies and builds on previous assessments in 1997 and 2002 which found that the pristine Arctic environment is polluted by industries in other parts of the globe.About 100 tons of man-made mercury emissions are deposited in the Arctic Ocean annually from the air, with a similar amount coming in with ocean currents, rivers and coastal erosion, the report said. Mercury gets into the environment from coal-fired power plants, residential heating systems, waste incinerators and mining operations.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("Peter Hill, of the DEP water bureau, said the Connecticut Yankee monitoring program has evolved since it began in 1997. Today, there are 40 test wells drilled on the nuclear plant campus and one across the river in Haddam. Further studies of the geology, Hill said, were ongoing.Only since a DEP mandate came down in March 2001 has Connecticut Yankee tested for the "hard to detect" particles like Strontium 90.Connecticut Yankee officials said the early rounds of testing lacked tests for HTDs by design."We've taken a phased approach. We started with the easy elements first to get a general sense of the plume. Now we're getting more specific," said Bob Capstick, Connecticut Yankee spokesman.For many years, the public has known about radioactive groundwater caused by several chronic leaks over the course of the nuclear plant's 28-year operating history. Well-documented levels ofradioactive Tritium caused the company to import bottled drinking water many years ago. Because Tritium flows easily through the water, its concentrations have diluted substantially according to the well reports.But Strontium 90 levels have not followed the same trend. A chart issued by Connecticut Yankee showing the concentrations from three wells reads like the tickers of fluctuating stocks that begin and end the day at the same price.Connecticut Yankee officials say this is because they have not removed the contaminant's source. They believe Strontium 90 leaked from the bottom of a corroded tank that stored reactor water, but decommissioning crews still have to remove three tanks in the area before the polluted soil underneath can be dug up."We anticipate that by removing the soil the groundwater will improve," said Connecticut Yankee spokesperson Kelley Smith.Connecticut Yankee's perceived lack of urgency in addressing the radioactive groundwater is a chief contention in a breach of contract lawsuit filed by Bechtel Corp., the recently fired decommissioning contractor. Hired to clean up the site to a dose level of 10 millirems per year, Bechtel complained in its suit: "The dose levels due to Sr 90 contamination in the groundwater, alone, exceed the contract dose limit . . . from all sources."","IshaCSVtest.csv")

That happened despite growing warnings from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency since 2011 that state regulators were out of compliance with federal laws meant to protect underground drinking-water stores from oil field contamination.The injections are convenient for oil companies because drilling brings up 13 gallons of wastewater for every gallon of petroleum.

Previously, low levels of arsenic had been detected at an area abutting the playscape to the right of Jennings. This contamination was not related to fill use, the town has said, as there were no records of projects at the site using Public Works pile materials.Due to the proximity of this site to the timber framing of the right playscape, explained Cummings, the district suspected that the arsenic detected had leached out from the pressure-treated timbers nearby. Thus, they ordered further testing of the wood itself at both playscapes.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Companies that built mines for silver, lead, gold and other “hardrock” minerals could move on once they were no longer profitable, leaving behind tainted water that still leaks out of the mines or is cleaned up at taxpayer expense. The records show that at average flows, more than 50 million gallons (189 million liters) of contaminated wastewater streams daily from the sites. In many cases, it runs untreated into nearby groundwater, rivers and ponds — a roughly 20-million-gallon (76-million-liter) daily dose of pollution that could fill more than 2,000 tanker trucks.The remainder of the waste is captured or treated in a costly effort that will need to carry on indefinitely, for perhaps thousands of years, often with little hope for reimbursement.The volumes vastly exceed the release from Colorado’s Gold King Mine disaster in 2015, when a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup crew inadvertently triggered the release of 3 million gallons (11.4 million liters) of mustard-colored mine sludge, fouling rivers in three states.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Tolune was the only volatile organic compound found, but concentrations were well below the guidelines, according to the report.“The only compound that came up with a bulls-eye on its back was arsenic,” Steve Edwards, an environmental consultant, told the Board of Selectmen on Wednesday.The sample showed a concentration of 13 milligrams per kilogram of the compound, he said, 3 milligrams above the Residential and Industrial/Commercial Direct Exposure criteria.The surplus soil has been on the property since 2018, when it was moved there following a building expansion at the Westport Senior Center. Edwards said a $40,000 cost for trucking and disposal deterred a decision to haul the material off site at the time.“The material was then temporarily stockpiled at the southern part of the property,” he said. “It’s important to note all of the material in that stockpile was from on site. There was no trucking in.”The property was formerly the location of a greenhouse and swimming pool owned by the Austrian Baron Walter Langer von Langendorff, and the town purchased the property after Langer died. Edwards explained there could be various reasons why the arsenic traces are in the soil.The area was a very popular site for rodents, he said, and extensive gardens and gardening activities also occurred at the location.“So if Baron had any kind of seeds or things like that, arsenic was used to control rodents,” he said.Public Works Director Peter Ratkiewich said he hopes to have the pile moved in the coming months, suggesting it could be placed under Green Farms Station’s parking lot or the Baldwin parking lot.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Many that have higher levels correlate to historical industrial discharges," said Vincent Breslin, associate professor of science education and environmental studies at SCSU.The contamination is the result of decades of unregulated industrial pollution, partly from factories such as Malleable Iron Fittings, which no longer exists, and Atlantic Wire. Samples the students took near Mill Plain Road showed a heavy concentration of lead, believed caused by the emissions from gasoline before environmental regulations required unleaded fuel.The students did their work last July as part of one of Breslin’s classes. He said his inspiration was a former student, Steve Gangi of Branford, a member of the Branford River Project.The project is a volunteer group of residents who look out for the welfare of the 10.5-mile river, which runs from Lake Gaillard in North Branford to Branford Harbor.While riding in canoes, students took samples from 18 sites along the river and in the harbor, from Exit 55 south to between Jeffrey and Johnson points."When you study sediment, you’re looking at the history of the last 20 to 30 years," said Donna Lawnsby, a science teacher at North Branford High School who took Breslin’s class as part of a master’s degree in environmental education.While parts of the river were affected, "the results showed, generally, that the Branford River is not very contaminated" in its upper section. The harbor sediment also is not overly contaminated, she said.Breslin said fewer metals now are being discharged into the water, so sediments are getting cleaner over time. A decline in pollution also occurs because contaminated sediment is buried under new layers as time goes on. "I don’t think people are in danger of eating fish they catch in the river …," he said. "A worm that’s living in sediment wouldn’t necessarily carry the chemicals that would be passed on to a fish." Copper would occur naturally at about 25 parts per million in the river and the harbor. In 11 of the 18 sampling sites, the level of contamination was at least twice that amount.Similarly, zinc would naturally occur at 64 ppm, but was measured at at least twice that level at 11 sites.An area south of the Riverview Apartments near Branford High School showed high overall metal contamination, with lead, copper and zinc three to four times natural levels.Breslin said the contamination came from many sources, including copper-based paints on the bottoms of boats and effluent from industry and the town’s sewage-treatment plant.

During their meeting last week, committee members said they were leaning toward the Tabor property, which has a long and litigious history, because it has more room and flexibility than another site they were looking at on Northeast Industrial Road. Horne said state-of-the-art remediation could adequately lessen any problems that arise, but there is still some uncertainty."You've got an undefined mix of chemicals in the landfill -- plastics, wood preservative, etc. -- it's like a big pressure cooker.

The new roadway, scheduled for completion in spring 1997, is a crucial section of Interstate 880 that will once again link the rest of the freeway with Interstate 80 and the Bay Bridge. That connection has been severed since the Cypress Structure collapsed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake."Ever since the contaminants were identified last year, we have been working around that site," said Stephen Williams, spokesman for Caltrans. "We're not pulling any punches. We have a conscience, and we're going to make sure there is no danger to the public."A delay in the completion date would be a major blow to East Bay commuters, who are becoming increasingly exasperated by jammed freeways. To avoid delays, Caltrans is proposing to sink hollow pilings into the ground and seal them off with cement before building the structure on top.Williams said the hollow-piling technique, which has been used successfully at other toxic sites, would not disturb the soil as much as solid footings, because less dirt is displaced.Exposure to vinyl chloride over a period of several years can cause rare cancers of the liver, nervous system and lymphomas in the mouth and the lungs.Ron Baker, spokesman for the Department of Toxic Substance Control, said that when disturbed, the gas can produce toxic fumes.

Five years ago, under federal Clean Air Act requirements, cars started switching to MTBE-boosted gasoline on a large scale to reduce air pollution. MTBE, a volatile organic compound made from natural gas and methanol, adds oxygen to gas, making it burn cleaner.Today, as some scientists begin to view MTBE as a wolf in sheep's clothing, citizens, politicians and resource agencies are grappling over whether to risk its continued use, or find a substitute. In 1992, the federal Clean Air Act required that cities with the worst carbon monoxide problems use a clean-fuel gas in the winter months to cut pollution. California required 80 percent of the state to use it. Ninety percent of the gas stations carried MTBE-added gas; the rest had ethanol-added gas.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("SHANGHAI (AP) -- China's environmental authorities were redoubling efforts Monday to prevent a spill of toxic cadmium from further tainting water supplies of cities downstream.Official reports have provided little information about the exact cause of the spill, whose impact was first seen in fish kills in mid-January. The contamination initially was blamed on a mining company, but officials now say further investigation is needed to confirm that finding.Cadmium, used to make batteries, is poisonous and can cause cancer.The spill prompted residents of Liuzhou, a city of 3.2 million in southwestern China's Guangxi region, to stock up on bottled water, though officials said efforts to neutralize the cadmium were keeping the water within safe levels and the city could use groundwater reserves if water from local rivers and reservoirs becomes too contaminated. Chinese rivers, lakes and coastal waters are heavily polluted due to inadequate controls on industries, runoff from farms and urban sewage. The area near Hechi, the city upstream on the Longjiang River, where the cadmium was first detected, has seen repeated spills from smelters and miners operating in the area.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("ALBANY, N.Y. -- The federal Environmental Protection Agency is considering a plan to perform only limited dredging of PCB-contaminated sediments in the Hudson River followed by more study, New York's attorney general said Tuesday.If adopted by EPA Administrator Christie Whitman, the plan would represent a scaling back of a proposal put forward by her agency last December under former President Clinton to dredge 2.65 million cubic yards of PCB-laden "hotspots" in the river north of Albany.Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said discussions between his staff and top Whitman aides indicated that a pilot dredging program is being seriously considered by the EPA administrator. Spitzer said such a plan, to be accompanied by years of studying the effects of the limited dredging on the river and the communities along its banks, is "unacceptable." Judith Enck, a policy adviser for Spitzer on the environment, said the dredging proposal advanced by the EPA last year is also apparently still under consideration by Whitman.Mary Mears, a spokeswoman for the EPA in New York City, said Whitman has not made a final decision on dredging and had no comment about Spitzer's statements.The General Electric Co., which would be responsible for much of the cost of a cleanup, staunchly opposed the EPA dredging proposal last year as did many residents in communities along the upper Hudson River. GE ran an advertising campaign against the dredging plan that former CEO John "Jack" Welch Jr. said cost between $10 million and $15 million.GE spokesman Mark Behan said he would not speculate about an EPA dredging decision."We don't know what EPA is considering, he said.The EPA placed the cost of the cleanup under its 2000 proposal at $460 million.Spitzer's aides said the alternative plan would cost about $100 million. It was not clear whether GE would cover all of those costs or share them with the government, Enck said.The plan Spitzer said is under consideration by Whitman would involve dredging most of the Thompson Island Pool, which is near Fort Edward and considered the most contaminated of the polluted sites in the Hudson.Whitman is expected to make a decision on Hudson River dredging within the next week or so, and environmentalists have been trying to put pressure on her to stick with the December dredging plan.GE discharged PCBs into the upper Hudson until 1977, when they were banned by the federal government. Polychlorinated biphenyls have been linked to cancer in laboratory animals, but no definitive link to cancer in humans has been made.Richard Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat who chairs the state Assembly's environmental conservation committee, said the alternative plan outlined by Spitzer's aides Tuesday would be an "awful stretch" given the position the agency took in 2000."They started with a broad plan, then they went to the hot spots," Brodsky said. "If they now narrow the hot spots, they're going to end up with a plan that makes everybody angry."A pilot dredging proposal for the Hudson would be similar to a project the EPA had oversight on at the Fox River in Wisconsin, according to Enck. It involved the dredging of PCB-tainted sediments blamed on paper mill pollution. Enck said environmentalists did not think the project was properly carried out or that the Fox River was substantially cleaner afterward.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

An additive to gasoline, MTBE provides more oxygen in gas to reduce air pollution standards but causes a problem when it leaks into the groundwater, Motes said.The groundwater at the Milldale XtraMart was found to be contaminated with ethylbenzene and xylene, both also found in gasoline with the ability to cause an environmental hazard if the contaminant levels are above a certain criteria within the surrounding groundwater.As the situations are being studied by Drake Petroleum, Motes said he believes the polluted groundwater is the result of a leak in the underground storage tanks since it only takes a few gallons of gasoline to exceed the criteria.

Whether the environmental threat grows many times bigger depends on whether the oil company can turn the well completely off.Crews are using robot submarines to activate valves at the well head in hopes of cutting off the leak, which threatens the Gulf Coast's fragile ecosystem of shrimp, fish, birds and coral. If the effort fails, they'll have to start drilling again.The submarine work will take 24 to 36 hours, Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP Exploration and Production, said Sunday afternoon. Oil continued to leak nearly a mile underwater Sunday at the site where the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on Tuesday. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead.For the second consecutive day, high waves prevented boats and equipment from going out to clean the spill. Airplanes sprayed chemicals to break up the oil.The spill initially appeared to be easily manageable after the oil rig sank Thursday about 50 miles off the Louisiana coast, but it has turned into a more serious environmental problem.The oil spill has been growing -- officials said the oily sheen on the surface of the gulf covered about 600 square miles Sunday. The environmental damage would be especially serious if it reaches land.The spill was still about 70 miles from the mainland, but only about 30 miles from an important chain of barrier islands known as the Chandeleurs.The islands, part of a national wildlife refuge, are an important nesting ground for pelicans and other sea birds.

A parcel of property that is contaminated is - by operation of law - a "facility." The DEQ does not - in fact cannot - designate a property to be a facility. True, the department may have reason to believe a property is contaminated based on existing data, but a property owner always has the opportunity to show otherwise based on other information. If a property is contaminated, this triggers important protections for the homeowner, including imposing on the polluter the financial responsibility to clean up the property. Also, if a property is contaminated (is a facility), a potential new homeowner of the property must be informed of this fact by the existing homeowner. These are clearly reasonable and desirable public policy outcomes. We believe we have found the right balance in the Framework Agreement signed by DEQ and The Dow Chemical Co. in January 2005. The framework requires (as you suggest) that the worst contamination be addressed first while additional studies are conducted. The framework requires Dow to implement interim steps to address those properties with levels of dioxin at or above 1,000 parts per trillion (ppt). This was done for certain priority areas in 2005, and will expand to additional priority areas in 2006. The framework also references both the bioavailability study and the U-M blood study. The good news is that both of these studies should be substantially completed this year. The results of the bioavailability study may have direct bearing on the formula used in calculating a dioxin cleanup level. In contrast, the U-M blood study serves a purpose unrelated to the algorithm but pertinent to the overall health of residents living in the city of Midland and along the Tittabawassee River.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Similarly, the Policy Directive I issued to DEQ staff in July 2005 strikes an appropriate balance between the interests of existing and new homeowners, and the legal mandate that areas of contamination be cleaned up. The Directive states that the DEQ will consider property contaminated only if: 1) site-specific sampling data exists; 2) the property is identified as contaminated by the liable party in an approved work plan; or 3) reasonable and scientifically valid inferences can be drawn from existing data. It is this last point that troubles some people, but this goes to the heart of sound science. Scientists routinely draw inferences or reach conclusions based on representative data. Does it make sense to deprive the DEQ of the ability to review data in a scientific manner? Should we likewise deny Dow scientists the opportunity to draw inferences from their dioxin data? Should we deny U-M researchers the opportunity to reach conclusions regarding the blood study presently being conducted?I am hopeful that discussions on this issue can continue in a manner based on what is best for the environment, the public health, and the prosperity of your community.

They’ll tell more of the plan to stakeholders and the public at a 1 p.m. March 23 meeting at Wilcox Park Community Center in Bad Axe.

It was an initial hint that nutrient and bacteria levels were too high.In 2008, biologists sampled seven locations in the area. E. coli levels were high in 11 of the 18 samples in the Bad Axe Drain and in seven of 18 samples taken from the Bad Axe Creek. Samples taken near Berne and Campbell roads exceeded 10,000 E. coli per 100 ml of water, according to the DEQ.“It’s not unheard of,” Matousek said. “E. coli results can vary quite widely depending on where (the measurement) is taken.

Four years later, DEQ biologists say samples showed high levels of E. coli in nearly 80 miles of stream and parts of the creek and drains.Officials say too much phosphorus can trigger excessive algal growth, polluting the water, consuming and reducing oxygen and reducing habitat for aquatic and wildlife.Too much E. coli in the watershed creates a human health issue.

The early cleanup action is intended to limit contaminated sediment from moving downstream, according to the EPA.The agency hosted a public hearing to gather input on the proposed cleanup in April at Saginaw Valley State University. At that hearing, some residents suggested the project could be a waste of time since heavy erosion in recent years has shrunk the island considerably.The EPA said that based on public comment, it modified its proposed remedy to include a contingency that allows the agency to adjust the amount of sediment removed and the areas capped, based on studies of current conditions.The estimated cost for this cleanup option is $500,000.In related news, the next meeting of the Saginaw-Tittabawassee Rivers Contamination Community Advisory Group is planned for 6 to 9 p.m. Monday at SVSU's Curtiss Hall.The group meets monthly to discuss issues related to the Superfund site and its cleanup.

newsTextToCSV("Residents of the dioxin-polluted Tittabawassee flood plain are weary of waiting for state agencies or The Dow Chemical Co. to do something about the contamination. Twenty-six filed a class-action complaint against Dow Tuesday in Saginaw County Circuit Court.The suit seeks to represent about 2,000 people who have lived in the flood plain since January 1984.Plaintiffs believe that their property has been devalued and their health put at risk by historic dioxin deposited by Dow into the river.They hope a jury will decide that Dow should pay the pre-dioxin-discovery value of the property, pay punitive damages and set up a medical monitoring trust to cover future diagnosis of dioxin poisoning and treatments for residents exposed to the dioxin. "We really think Dow should step up to the plate," said Jan P. Helder, the Kansas City-based attorney representing the group. "If they don’t, we’ll make them. This case is about holding them accountable. The time for talk and delay is over."In 2002, families living along the Tittabawassee River and its flood plain were notified by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality that the soil in their backyards was contaminated with dioxin. The lawsuit contends that Dow was negligent in its handling and disposal of dioxin, resulting in levels as high as 7,300 parts per trillion. The state’s residential cleanup standard is 90 parts per trillion.The dioxin has been traced to Dow waste discharges into the river between 1915 and 1937.Dow has acknowledged its responsibility for the contamination. Two state agreements, one in 1985 that was the result of an exchange for building a boat launch, and another in 1997, deemed Dow released from all claims and action related to discharge of dioxins into the river.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The lawsuit alleges that oil drillers near Lago Agrio from the early 1970s until the early 1990s took advantage of lax Ecuadorean environmental standards to cut costs by dumping wastewater into open pits."They were making decisions they knew would have a devastating effect on the environment, because they wouldn't have drilled for oil that way in the United States or any other part of the world," said Joseph Kohn, a Philadelphia-based class action lawyer working on the case.Bonifaz said the oil company left behind some 350 ponds full of water contaminated with oil and cancer-causing chemicals scattered across a 31 mile by 62 mile area.Maripat Sexton, a ChevronTexaco spokeswoman in Houston, Texas, told The Associated Press that the oil company paid $40 million in a clean up agreement that the Ecuadorean government signed off on in 1998."The plaintiffs have yet to present any credible, substantiated independent evidence supporting a connection between Texaco operations _ which ended over a decade ago _ and an alleged negative impact," Sexton said.The case was first filed in U.S courts in 1993. After winding through the court system, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York sided with oil company lawyers, ruling in August that the case should be heard in Ecuador, where the damage allegedly occurred.The American lawyers originally wanted the case tried in U.S. courts because they said the Ecuadorean government's dependence on oil revenues would make it unlikely for courts to deliver justice. Oil exports account for about 40 percent of Ecuador's revenue.The lawyers worked with Ecuadorean legislators to draft a law similar to the U.S. Superfund law, which requires polluters in the United States to pay for cleanups even if a site was sold or is no longer operating.Ecuador passed its Superfund law in 1999, Bonifaz said. The U.S. Superfund Law was passed in 1980.He said he expected a ruling within six to seven months if the Ecuadorean court accepted the case. Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The massive oil leak resulting from the collapse of a drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico is an environmental, economic and political disaster.Some 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from leaks after a drilling platform leased by British Petroleum exploded April 20 as it floated in 5,000 feet of water, 50 miles south of Louisiana's fragile wetlands.The scale of the catastrophe will be determined by how quickly the flow of oil can be stopped -- estimates range from weeks to months. At its worse, it could take the Gulf Coast states years to recover from damage to fish, shore wildlife and the land. The oil slick even could escape the Gulf and pollute East Coast beaches. Obama's support of offshore drilling was seen as part of political compromises to gain support for his climate change legislation.It is unlikely new offshore drilling will be allowed without far tighter government supervision and improved ways to prevent and deal with oil spills. In this disaster, the blowout preventer, designed to stop a leak, failed, as did backup mechanisms. Oil companies are using the same methods used for the 1969 cleanup after an oil rig explosion off the Santa Barbara, Calif., coast.The fallout from this massive leak will add to the push for clean energy sources, such as wind and solar power, along with new restrictions on offshore drilling. However, alternative energy sources remain far more expensive than petroleum. They lack the capacity to meet a significant portion of the nation's energy needs. Oil will remain a major part of the nation's energy supply for at least a generation. One price of that dependence is catastrophes such as the one unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

Thad Allen said the goal was to free the saw and finish the cut later in the day. This is the latest attempt to contain - not plug - the gusher. The best chance at stopping the leak is a relief well, which is at least two months from completion."I don't think the issue is whether or not we can make the second cut. It's about how fine we can make it, how smooth we can make it," Allen said. Attorney General Eric Holder, who visited the Gulf on Tuesday, would not say who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history.The federal government also ramped up its response to the spill with President Barack Obama ordering the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill to thoroughly examine the disaster, "to follow the facts wherever they lead, without fear or favor."The president said that if laws are insufficient, they'll be changed. He said that if government oversight wasn't tough enough, that will change, too.BP has tried and failed repeatedly to halt the flow of the oil, and the latest attempt like others has never been tried before a mile beneath the ocean. Experts warned it could be even riskier than the others because slicing open the 20-inch riser could unleash more oil if there was a kink in the pipe that restricted some of the flow."It is an engineer's nightmare," said Ed Overton, a Louisiana State University professor of environmental sciences. "They're trying to fit a 21-inch cap over a 20-inch pipe a mile away. That's just horrendously hard to do.

The idea was to have Julian reduce the size of the pile, which has existed for several decades.Instead, the pile grew and neighbors began to complain. An inspector hired by the town spotted a suspicious load of debris, and testing later showed the existence of low levels of PCBs and lead on a small portion. The fill pile was shut down, and Julian’s contract ended.The remediation costs have not exceeded the $289,000 budgeted for that purpose, and the town is in the midst of a court case with Julian, seeking $3 million from the company. Julian has countersued, charging the town with defamation.A design for the capping of the pile, groundwater monitoring wells and a grading plan is in the process of being revised.

The men were cleaned off and taken to Albany Medical Center for observation, he said.However, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said about 420 gallons of crude oil spilled in an area designed with an embankment to contain spills. There was minimal soil impact, and tainted soil will be excavated and properly disposed of, DEC added. Albany County Executive Dan McCoy said the spill reinforced concerns over a request by Global to add a plant to heat crude oil to make it easier to ship during cold weather."Today's oil spill clearly demonstrates further review needs to be done before any permits for expansion are issued," said McCoy. "What if that oil had been Canadian tar sands (oil) and leaked into the Hudson River? That would have been disastrous."McCoy and other opponents of crude oil train shipments into the port continue to call for DEC to conduct a full environmental study before making any decision on the crude heating project.Global Partners did not specify if the spill was crude or diesel, but indicated a leak involved "a temporary, portable, 20,000-gallon, above-ground tank used in the performance of routine maintenance activities," according to a statement.

newsTextToCSV("ALLENTOWN, Pa. -- A blowout at a natural gas well in rural northern Pennsylvania spilled thousands of gallons of chemical-laced water Wednesday, contaminating a stream and forcing the evacuation of seven families who live nearby as crews struggled to stop the gusher.Chesapeake Energy Corp. lost control of the well site near Canton, in Bradford County, around 11:45 p.m. Tuesday, officials said. Tainted water continued to flow from the site Wednesday afternoon, though workers finally managed to prevent any more of it from reaching the stream.No injuries were reported, and there was no explosion or fire. Chesapeake said a piece of equipment failed late Tuesday while the well was being hydraulically fractured, or fracked. In the fracking process, millions of gallons of water, along with chemical additives and sand, are injected at high pressure down the well bore to break up the shale and release the gas.State environmental regulators were taking water samples from the unnamed tributary of Towanda Creek on Wednesday but did not report a fish kill. Towanda Creek is stocked with trout.Officials advised a neighboring farmer to prevent his cows from drinking surface water, according to DEP spokeswoman Katy Gresh.She said reports from the scene indicate that fracking water was gushing from the wellhead, pooling on the pad, then escaping containment."Discharge of fluids to the unnamed tributary appears to be stopped," she said.The blowout comes amid a natural gas-drilling boom in the Marcellus Shale formation below Pennsylvania and neighboring states. Fracking allows affordable access to gas supplies that once were too expensive to tap. Critics complain that the chemicals used in fracking may be contaminating water supplies.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("In the mid-1960s the town of Greenwich purchased a toxic waste dump known as "The 10 Acre Swamp" and seized seven homes under the doctrine of eminent domain. In a settlement signed with neighbors whose homes were not seized, the town agreed to remediate the swamp and maintain the entire wetlands "forever green."In 1974 the town discovered toxic waste bubbling up to the surface in the "remediated" wetlands. The town purchased additional property along the Post Road to build an athletic field, and obtained wetlands permits to fill the toxic swamp with clean fill. In the 1990s the town again obtained wetlands permits to fill the toxic swamp with clean fill. In 2002 the town again obtained wetlands permits to fill the swamp with clean fill. In 2010 the town again obtained wetlands permits to fill the toxic swamp with clean fill. The town of Greenwich has submitted documents to the Environmental Protection Agency in which the town states it has no idea how much toxic waste was originally dumped into the swamp. Recent tests found toxins in groundwater, and in soil at every test height sampled.This scenario has been repeated at thousands of sites across the country. "Love Canal" was the first fully remediated, and the best-known. The "Superfund" act was written in response to Love Canal, however, as so many polluted sites applied for funds, and as the cost of remediation proved so much greater than expected, the fund was soon depleted.Now all potential "Superfund" sites must register on a master list. Greenwich High School is on that list, but will not receive funds anytime soon for a variety of reasons, not least of which is Greenwich taxpayers can afford to remediate the site without federal funds, while less affluent neighborhoods, like Love Canal, cannot.The Greenwich High School site exposes children to long-term harm and medical uncertainty. No child should be allowed on this site. It is not clear this site will ever be safe for humans, even hundreds of years after removing all known carcinogens. It is not clear it is possible to remove all known carcinogens, and it is likely the entire site will be fully encapsulated, at great cost, in the same manner as "Love Canal," which is roughly the same size.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

She said she could not immediately respond to questions about how the accident happened.The well never caught fire and no injuries were reported, but state officials had worried the gas might explode before the well could be controlled.State environmental authorities promised an aggressive investigation of the circumstances surrounding the blowout, which they said shot gas and water 75 feet into the air."The event at the well site could have been a catastrophic incident that endangered life and property," Department of Environmental Protection Secretary John Hanger said in a statement. "This was not a minor accident, but a serious incident that will be fully investigated by this agency with the appropriate and necessary actions taken quickly."If the agency finds that mistakes were made, it will take steps to prevent similar errors from repeating, he said. He did not elaborate on any environmental damage. The well is on the grounds of a hunting club in Clearfield County, near Interstate 80 and about 90 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.Houston-based EOG was drilling into the Marcellus Shale reserve, a hotly pursued gas formation primarily under Pennsylvania, West Virginia, New York and Ohio that some geologists believe could become the nation's most productive natural gas field.Spadoni said details about the accident were still sketchy, but the agency was told that unexpectedly high gas pressure in the new well prevented the crew from containing it.The crew had just finished a process called hydraulic fracturing - in which millions of gallons of water, sand and chemicals are blasted underground to shatter tightly compacted shale and release trapped natural gas - and were clearing out debris from the well when gas shot out of it, he said.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The long-awaited cleanup of the Mill River is nearing an end.Barry Culp, senior project manager at TRC in Windsor, told the Board of Selectmen on Wednesday that removal of lead-contaminated sediment from the river should be completed by year’s end. “Our goal is to complete all of our dredging this year,” he said.But Culp said removal of equipment from the 6.25-acre property at 2190 Post Road that was formerly home to Exide Battery Co. factory, the source of the river’s lead contamination, likely won’t be finished until the summer of 2016.The cleanup, mandated by the state Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, divided 4,000 linear feet of the river into five sections, and the total amount of lead-contaminated sediment to be removed was estimated last year at 20,000 cubic yards. “I’m anticipating it’s going to be sometime late next summer when we’re going to have all our equipment offsite and all our guys scattered to the winds,” Culp said.TRC has been looking into bringing the dredged sediment to landfills in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, but Culp said a landfill hasn’t been chosen because the exact volume of sediment and when it will leave the Exide property aren’t known yet.Sediment from Area 2, the section of Mill River closest to the former factory, is being stored in separate geo-textile tubes and will be tested to determine if it’s hazardous. If it is, that sediment will go to Clean Earth in New Jersey for treatment, Culp said.“Everything we’re dredging from the river is leaving the site,” Culp said.Yellow buoys that passing motorists may have noticed in the river represent “turbidity curtains” that surround an area being dredged, Culp said. He said dredged sediment is pumped to large geo-textile tubes on the Exide property. Water is then pumped into a treatment system to be cleaned before it’s returned to the river, while the sediment stays enclosed in geo-textile tubes on the property. Culp said the temperature of water is tested before it’s returned to the river so it doesn’t create thermal plumes and that workers monitor air around the geo-textile tubes and stormwater runoff from the site as well.“To date, all the remediation has been performing to requirements,” Culp told the selectmen. “As far as remediation projects go, it’s been fairly straightforward.”Exide closed its battery plant in 1981 and its factory sat vacant for about 25 years before it was demolished in 2005 and lead-contaminated soil was removed from the Post Road land.

The state showed a great interest in this agreement and may be using this as a quasi template for other agreements in similar situations around the state.” The Daily News reported in December 1979 that the property at 815 Ashman was one of three pollutant sites where groundwater had been contaminated by pollutants. The site, a former gasoline station with a saddle-shaped roof, was found to have gasoline leaking from an underground tank. The station was closed for about three and a half weeks to allow station owners to rectify the situation.A 10,0000 gallon tank used to store gasoline was found to be faulty and was filled with sand. Two other tanks, one 10,000 gallons and the other 6,000, were lined with fiberglass to prevent leakage.“The only exposure is ground water.

Sandy soil makes the aquifer vulnerable to contamination, which can travel quickly.But as work has gone on, more and more pollution has turned up, sometimes at very high levels.Most recently, perchlorate, a pollutant associated with rocket fuel that's suspected of causing thyroid disease, showed up in water supply wells in Bourne, forcing the community to connect to an alternate water supply provided by the military. The supply is permanent but now provides about 3 million gallons a day, a fraction of what will ultimately be needed.On the camp itself, explosives contaminants have turned up in about 100 monitoring wells, and in 53 of them at levels exceeding EPA's health advisory, EPA data showed. More than 200 monitoring wells have been installed throughout the camp.In the part of the camp known as demolition area 1, the explosives-related, possibly cancer-causing contaminant RDX has been found in groundwater at concentrations as high as 370 parts per billion -- well above the EPA's standard of two parts per billion, data showed.In the range's southeast corner -- near the most productive part of the aquifer -- perchlorate concentrations as high as 311 parts per billion have been found near the base boundary, upgrade from Snake Pond, a swimming pond for a children's camp, data showed. EPA doesn't have a standard established for the contaminant but suggests a range of 4-18 parts per billion for adults.","IshaCSVtest.csv")
