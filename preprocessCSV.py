newsTextToCSV("Drinking water in three Macomb and St. Clair county communities tested positive for contamination, according to state environmental officials. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality found perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in water in New Baltimore, Mount Clemens and Ira Township, MLive reported. The agency tested groundwater and treated drinking water in the area in January. The department issued letters March 2 alerting residents to the presence of the substances, which have been used in non-stick cookware, stain resistant fabrics and firefighting foams. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, thyroid disorders, elevated cholesterol and other diseases. Current contamination levels don't pose any significant danger, the department said. \”I want to assure the residents of the city that their water is safe to drink and that a boil water advisory has not been issued,\” New Baltimore Mayor John Dupray said. \”I will be attending a meeting with the MDEQ early next week to discuss this issue in greater detail. We strive to provide the highest quality water possible and will continue to do so.\” The contamination is believed to have originated in Lake St. Clair, though the exact source is unknown. Last year, Gov. Rick Snyder announced that the state is committed to spending more than $23 million to combat PFAS contamination. Plainfield Township, the Saginaw-Midland Corp., Huron Shores Regional Water Authority system in Tawas, Ann Arbor, Grayling and the village of Sparta have also detected PFAS in their water.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("CASCADE TOWNSHIP — Testing of private drinking wells near an airport southeast of Grand Rapids has found chemical contaminants after a report identified the airport's extensive use of toxic firefighting foam. WOOD-TV reports that Gordon Water Systems tested 20 wells at homes near the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Kent County. Many residents requested testing after the news station revealed the airport used the toxic firefighting foam for more than two decades. The company, which services Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids and Portage, found perfluorinated chemicals in four wells. The chemicals are often found in the firefighting foam. The tests didn't find any perfluorinated chemicals above the state's limit for drinking water. But many residents say the results show that widespread testing is needed.

newsTextToCSV("Submerged cables that carried electricity between Michigan's two peninsulas were shut down after leaking about 550 gallons of coolant fluid into the waterway that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, officials said Tuesday. The fluid is a mineral-based synthetic oil used for insulation that can be harmful if released into the environment, said Jackie Olson, spokeswoman for American Transmission Co., which operates the cables. It was too early to know what ecological damage might have been done in the Straits of Mackinac, said Joe Haas, district supervisor for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. No warnings were issued for people to avoid the area, where shoreline areas remain blanketed with ice, said Lt. Rachel Wellman of the U.S. Coast Guard. \“We've confirmed the risk to human health is very low at the greatest,\” she said. Michigan's environmental agency advised nearby towns to monitor their drinking water. The leak was discovered after the two cables tripped offline Sunday evening, the company said in a statement. Pressure on the system was reduced Monday to keep the loss to a minimum as personnel traced the source of the leak. The cause was unknown and it wasn't immediately clear whether both cables were leaking, although both had sustained damage, Olson said. Crews were attempting to use hoses and a vacuum truck to pump out whatever fluid remained in the cables, Wellman said. The Coast Guard had two vessels standing by, with four mechanical skimmers and several thousand feet of boom, in case any of the material rose to the surface. Any of the liquid that isn't recovered or does not wash onto shoreline ice is likely to break up within a few days, Wellman said. The leaked coolant is known to be highly toxic to at least one type of aquatic insect in the Great Lakes but is considered less of a threat to fish, Haas said. \”That's encouraging, but it doesn't mean we aren't taking this very seriously,\” he said. \”This is obviously something we don't want in these public trust waters.\“ Pewaukee, Wis.-based American Transmission Co. owns and operates most of the electric transmission grid in Michigan's Upper Peninsula as well as parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. One of the Straits of Mackinac cables was installed in 1975 and the other in the 1990s, Olson said. Wintry weather and the heavy shoreline ice hampered the company's investigation of the leak and influenced the decision Tuesday to shut down the cables.  No customers lost electric service because power was routed from other sources, she said. Although the cables were damaged beyond repair, the company is looking into restoring an electrical connection between Michigan's Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula. \“We will continue to investigate the cause of the incident, determine any necessary remediation efforts and continue communicating with the appropriate regulatory agencies,\“ COO Mark Davis said.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LAPEER (AP) — For more than 20 years, the Michigan town of Lapeer sent leftover sludge from its sewage treatment plant to area farms, supplying them with high-quality, free fertilizer while avoiding the expense of disposal elsewhere. But state inspectors ordered a halt to the practice in 2017 after learning the material was laced with one of the potentially harmful chemicals known collectively as PFAS, which are turning up in drinking water and some foods across the U.S. Now, the city of 8,800 expects to pay about $3 million to have the waste treated at another facility and the leftover solids shipped to a landfill. Testing has found elevated PFAS levels in just one field where the sludge was spread, but farmers have lost an economical fertilizer source and hope more contamination doesn't turn up. \”I feel bad for them,\“ said Michael Wurts, superintendent of the waste treatment plant, who ruefully recalls promoting sludge as an agricultural soil additive to growers in the community. \“The city didn't do anything malicious. We had no clue this was going on.\“ Lapeer isn't alone. For decades, sewage sludge from thousands of wastewater treatment plants has been used nationwide as cropland fertilizer. It's also applied to sports fields, golf courses and backyard gardens. About half of the 7 million tons generated annually in the U.S. is applied to farm fields and other lands, the Environmental Protection Agency says. While the sludge offers farmers a cheap source of fertilizer, there long have been concerns about contaminants in the material — and attention of late has turned to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The city of Marinette, Wisconsin, has stopped distributing sewage waste, also called \”biosolids,\” to farms after getting high PFAS readings. In Maine, a dairy farm was forced to shut down after sludge spread on the land was linked to high levels of PFAS in the milk. \“It's been devastating. We kind of get treated like we are criminals,\“ said Stoneridge Farm's Fred Stone, whose blood has also tested high for PFAS from what he believes was drinking contaminated water and milk over the years. The concern is that certain PFAS chemicals, which studies have associated with increased risk of cancer and damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid, could be absorbed by crops grown in soils treated with polluted sludge and wind up in foods. The Food and Drug Administration this year reported finding substantial levels of the chemicals in random samples of grocery store meats, dairy products, seafood and even off-the-shelf chocolate cake, although the study did not mention any connection to sewage waste. \“The FDA continues to work with other federal agencies to identify sources and reduce or eliminate pathways for dietary PFAS exposure including through use of biosolids,\“ spokeswoman Lindsay Haake said. The extent of any threat to the food supply is unknown because so little testing has been done, scientists say. \“We don't have a lot of data but the data we have suggests it's a problem,\“ Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said at a recent conference in Boston. \“We are finding that there are elevated levels of different PFAS in biosolids. We clearly need more research in this area.\“ Studies have documented PFAS absorption by some crops — lettuce, tomatoes and radishes among them — from soils fertilized with sewage byproducts. And the EPA's inspector general reported last year that the agency was falling short in tracking hundreds of pollutants in sludge, including PFAS. Yet despite growing evidence that at least some sludge is contaminated, the federal government hasn't limited PFAS in fertilizer or developed a standard for determining safe levels. That leaves fertilizer companies and farmers wondering what to do and fearful of consumer backlash. \“If you want to destroy agriculture in Michigan, start talking about, 'Hey, it could be contaminated with PFAS,\“ said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. \“People will see that and say, 'Oh, we can't trust them, we'll buy from elsewhere,' even though the problem is no worse in Michigan than it is anywhere else.\“ Studies going back almost two decades found PFAS in sludge, primarily from industrial wastewater that flows to municipal treatment facilities. Residential sewage is another source — from carpets, clothes and other household items containing PFAS. The grease- and water-resistant compounds, known as \“forever chemicals\“ because they don't degrade naturally and are believed capable of lingering indefinitely in the environment, also are found in firefighting foam used at military bases and airports. Evidence of a link between PFAS-laced sludge and food emerged in 2008, when the EPA found elevated levels of several compounds in sludge that a Decatur, Alabama utility had spread on 5,000 acres of farmland. They were detected in nearby waters and vegetation from the fields. The chemicals were traced to several companies that manufactured and used PFAS. \“I'm very concerned about replicating that in other states,\“ EPA's Andrew Lindstrom, whose lab ran tests there, said at the Boston conference. Milk from one dairy contained 270 parts per trillion of PFAS — almost four times the agency's nonbinding health risk level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, the two best- known chemicals in the class. An EPA \“action plan\“ in February acknowledged \“information gaps\“ about tainted sludge. It said the agency was developing better detection methods and assessing risks posed by PFOA and PFOS, which no longer are manufactured in the U.S. but remain widespread in the environment. \“We are studying the potential pathways by which PFAS are getting into biosolids and we are researching alternative methods for removing or destroying PFAS in biosolids if analysis indicates that detected levels are of risk and need reduction,\“ the agency told The Associated Press in a statement. Advocacy groups say EPA also should look at chemicals developed as replacements for PFOA and PFOS, which studies found accumulate in edible parts of plants. \“At least EPA should require that sludge be tested for PFAS before being applied to farm fields,\“ said Colin O'Neil, legislative director with the Environmental Working Group. Its inspector general reported last year that the EPA had identified 352 pollutants, including PFAS, in biosolids. But the report concluded the agency had too little data and other tools to assess their safety. Regulations require testing for only nine pollutants in sludge, all heavy metals. Several states are examining sewage sludge for PFAS contamination and assessing potential dangers. Maine has enacted a nonbinding advisory level for PFAS in sludge and New Hampshire is working with the U.S. Geological Survey on a soil study whose results will help them set a standard. Maine also found most biosolids from more than 30 wastewater treatment plants were above the state's advisory level while neighboring New Hampshire detected PFAS in tests of sludge from two dozen permit holders. Neither state found traceable levels of PFAS in the milk tested. Based on sludge tests at 41 plants, Michigan ordered several to stop distributing it to farms. After the state's environmental department ordered some plants to trace PFAS sent to them, several installed treatment systems that sharply reduced their pollution output, spokesman Scott Dean said. Among them was Lapeer Plating & Plastics, the automotive chrome manufacturer that caused the Lapeer contamination. But City Manager Dale Kerbyson said the company has reneged on a promise to help cover Lapeer's costs of dealing with the pollution and a lawsuit may be coming. \“I don't think the citizens of our city should have to pay for this,\“ Kerbyson said. Lapeer Plating & Plastics did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment. Although they complain about a lack of government standards, some cities and towns fear strict rules that could force costly infrastructure upgrades or sending sludge to out-of-state landfills. And companies worry they will be put out of business. \“This is the biggest issue that has hit the biosolids recycling profession in North America ever, because of regulatory overreaction,\“ said Ned Beecher, executive director of the North East Biosolids and Residuals Association. Companies that manufacture compost — some from sewage sludge — contend tough standards are premature until scientists determine acceptable PFAS levels. \“We don't want people jumping to conclusions,\“ said Frank Franciosi, executive director of the U.S. Composting Council. If EPA cracks down on anyone, he said, it should be those who manufacture and use PFAS chemicals that enter the waste stream.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) released the following statement regarding the collapse of a contaminated site into the Detroit River near a water intake site: \“This week, my team and I became aware of the collapse of dock at the Revere Copper site into the Detroit River near an intake site for a water system that services millions of people across Michigan. It is alarming that we, like many others, only became aware of this through a news report a week after the incident occurred at a site that once processed radioactive materials. My office has been in contact with the EPA’s Region 5 office as well as the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. Both the EPA and EGLE have made assurances to our office that based on testing done by the Department of Energy and EPA in the 1980s as the site was decommissioned and testing done by EGLE in April of this year, there is no current risk of exposure to radioactive material. I am also aware that testing for radiation at the site was conducted by EGLE, EPA, and the FBI today, and that they have informed my office that no radiation was found today. This afternoon, I sent a letter to both EPA and EGLE requesting additional information of past testing and in-depth information on what health and environmental risks may exist due to the collapse, including any risks to our public drinking water system. In the spirit of transparency and trust, it is imperative that these agencies are as forthcoming and engaging with the public as possible with what is going on and what has occurred. The public deserves nothing less. Those assurances notwithstanding, there are still major unanswered questions about what was spilled into the river when the dock collapsed, what pollutants may have been exposed by the collapse and disturbance of the river bed, and what testing and remediation will take place to ensure the site is safe and that the collapse has not endangered our public health. Detroit Bulk Storage and Revere Dock LLC have put their own profits ahead of the public’s well-being by not following processes that protect public health and our environment. They did not notify officials of the incident, instead working to cover up the collapse without proper safety equipment. Our residents don't deserve to continue to be dumped on by corporate polluters with no accountability, and I expect the owners and operators of this site to be held accountable swiftly, including by providing answers about what happened to the public and paying for any cleanup and remediation that is necessary. Moreover, I have significant concerns about the delay in both notifying the public about this collapse and the government regulatory agencies’ response, as it appears that EPA and EGLE found out about the collapse through media inquiries from the Windsor Star. EGLE has primary responsibility for the response and any cleanup, and EPA has committed to supporting EGLE in any way it can. EGLE is on site today and its response is ongoing, and EGLE will provide another update to our office and local stakeholders on Monday. EGLE has committed to working with the Great Lakes Water Authority and Detroit Water and Sewage Department to understand their water testing procedures and ensure there is no threat to our public drinking water. GLWA today issued a statement confirming that they will be testing water at their facilities for radionucleotides. “This incident appears to be yet another example of the need to have tight safeguards for industry, especially those who operate near resources that millions depend out. Every family should have clean air and clean water – any incident that endangers that should be given the utmost urgency. My office will continue to push for answers and ensure that no one is being put in harm’s way, urge EPA and EGLE to conduct all necessary testing to ensure public health, and will relay information to the public as soon as we are able.\”","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("MACOMB COUNTY — The Macomb County Public Works Office said Jan. 4 that the search for the source of a petroleum spill into the Schoenherr Relief Drain in Warren, and subsequently into the Clinton River, is still ongoing. MCPWO officials said the leak was originally cited the morning of Jan. 3 by a resident along the Clinton River, near Budd Park in Clinton Township. That individual reportedly noticed a sheen moving down the river, leading to an immediate investigation and response. \“Thanks to a concerned citizen, we were able to catch this flow of petroleum before the bulk of it made it to Lake St. Clair,\” Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said in a press release. \“We are all one big watershed, and all the storm water in the metro area runs out to Lake St. Clair or other parts of the Great Lakes Basin. We all have to work together to prevent pollution from entering the lakes.\” Personnel from fire departments and public works offices in Clinton Township, Sterling Heights and Warren assisted the MCPWO Jan. 3 to track the source of the sheen back to the Schoenherr Relief Drain, near 14 Mile and Schoenherr roads. That drain, according to the MCPWO, \“is a large, underground storm drain that travels south (to) north under Schoenherr Road, from Nine Mile Road to just north of 14 Mile Road.\” It enters the Red Run, which then enters the Clinton River and eventually transports water out to Lake St. Clair. The office estimated \“between 75 and 100 gallons\” of petroleum entered the drain, causing containment booms to be put in place. It was believed that petroleum in that relief drain came from a fuel storage tank of some sort, due to the volume of material in the drain. On Jan. 4, investigators made \“several manned entries\” into the underground drain in question in Warren. The absorbent booms were to remain in place until the water runs clear of all petroleum. Miller vowed that whoever is responsible for the leak will be held accountable, saying \“the day where (polluting the lake) was acceptable is over and the conversation has changed.\” That includes recouping costs and taking \“other actions\” as necessary, she added. \“This incident shows how all of our storm water drains are part of one larger system,\” she said. \“Here’s a spill that happened in Warren and was seen in the river some five or 10 miles away, on the way out to Lake St. Clair. We appreciate the responsible citizens who alert us to these incidents. We continue to be vigilant and make inspections of our drains, but we also rely on our good neighbors for assistance in sounding the alarm when there is a problem.\” The office issued another update Jan. 6, saying that \“water was running mostly clear from the drain.\” However, some residual petroleum was still seen in the water. The source was still undiscovered. The MCPWO maintains a 24-hour pollution notification number at (877) 679-4337.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LANSING – Heavy rains last week caused roughly 11 million gallons of sewage and storm water to pour into the Grand and Red Cedar rivers. More than 10 million gallons poured into the Grand River and roughly 470,000 gallons into the Red Cedar River. A public access point on the Grand near Moore's Park was potentially affected by the overflow, the city said. That's on top of 25 million gallons of sewage and storm water that went into the Grand River and 1.9 million and went into the Red Cedar River after more than 2 inches of rain from Oct. 2 storms. Bill Brunner, plant engineer at Lansing's waste water treatment facility, said during heavy rainfall, the combined water and sewer pipes cannot carry any more water and excess is channeled into the rivers. Until the rain stops and the flow recedes, water and sewage continue being diverted into the rivers, he said. Consistent rain during the last two weeks has led to more water going into the pipes because the ground cannot absorb more moisture. \“That really does have an effect,\“ Brunner said. The most recent overflow began at 8 a.m. Oct. 11, and it stopped around 1 a.m. Oct. 12. The bulk of the sewage and water went into the Grand River between the dam at Moore’s Park and St. Joseph Cemetery in the northwest section of Lansing, the city said. Overflow into the Red Cedar River came from outfalls near the intersection of East South and South Cedar streets and from behind the Lansing Board of Water & Light facility on East Hazel Street.

newsTextToCSV("LANSING — An underground plume of chemical pollution is creeping toward wells that supply some of the Lansing region's drinking water. It isn't there yet, and the trust that controls the former General Motors properties, where the pollution started, hope to keep it that way. They proposed removing the pollution by injecting air into the water to encourage bacteria to gobble up the 1,4-dioxane, the pollutant lurking underground. It's unclear what the project would cost, but it would be among the first and likely the largest use of that remediation method, called \”biosparging,\” on dioxane. It's a high-profile project among pollution remediation experts around the country. \”They’re well known because they're one of the few places that has taken this issue head-on,\” said David Adamson, Principal Engineer with GSI Environmental in Houston, Texas. First, the trust needs to present its plans to the community during an upcoming meeting and get approval from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, the state's newly renamed Department of Environmental Quality. There are few signs left of the GM plants straddling Saginaw Road in Lansing Township. The properties are gated swaths of cracked concrete; scrub trees and brush have grown tall in the years since they shuttered. The old GM properties are held by the Revitalizing Auto Communities Environmental Response Trust, or RACER Trust, which the federal government established when GM declared bankruptcy in 2011 to clean the sites and get them ready for redevelopment. The trust was funded with federal money and the value of GM assets. The trust controls four sites in the Lansing area: Plant 5, a 25-acre parcel in Delta Township; Plants 2 and 3 in Lansing Township, which are 72 and 105.25 acres, respectively; and 57-acre Plant 6 in the City of Lansing. The dioxane plume is underneath Plants 2 and 3 and near Plant 6. The sites are under a purchase contract with NorthPoint Development, RACER Trust announced in 2016. Dioxane is an industrial chemical used in laboratories and in adhesives or sealants, according to the EPA. It's also used to stabilize other chemicals and keep them from breaking down, said Dave Favero, deputy cleanup manager for the Michigan RACER properties. That's why it's usually found with other chemical pollution, not on its own like it is in Lansing Township. Dioxane was used at the GM Plants as part of a mixture used to clean oil off car parts, but it doesn't like to stay with oil. \”1,4 dioxane is very soluble, so if it's in the oil it would rather be in water,\” Favero said. \”It leaches out and starts to migrate with the groundwater.\” Dioxane in the environment can be dangerous to human health, according to EPA reports. It is likely cancer-causing, and long-term exposure could cause liver, kidney and reproductive problems. The dioxane plume in Lansing Township is within the Lansing Board of Water and Light's \”wellhead protection area\” for some of its drinking water wells. Up to 10 of the utility's 125 wells are downstream of the polluted groundwater. BWL, which provides drinking water to 56,000 customers in Lansing and surrounding townships, started monitoring for dioxane in 2015 when the EPA asked utility companies to test for certain contaminants in their water supplies. They found a small amount of dioxane — .14 parts dioxane per billion parts water — within the limits of what the EPA considers safe, .35 parts per billion. BWL has monitored for dioxane in the groundwater quarterly sincelate 2016 and it has never exceeded the EPA's safe limit. The utility posts monitoring results online at lbwl.com. \”We're supportive of the [RACER] remediation efforts because it's ultimately going to help clean up the site as well as remove any potential contamination to drinking water,\” said Lori Myott, manager of BWL's environmental services department. BWL's drinking water wells tap into an aquifer hundreds of feet below the contaminated groundwater, general counsel Mark Matus said. The pollution starts on the Plant 3 property and has spread southeast under Saginaw Road to the southerly Plant 2 property. It's now an oblong shape that reaches 80 feet below the surface to the top of the groundwater. The Lansing-area plume has between 300 and 400 parts dioxane per billion parts water. State regulations say dioxane must be cleaned from the environment if levels reach more than 7.2 parts per billion. The biggest risk of having dioxane in the environment is its potential to get into drinking water, but most water utility companies rarely monitor for it, Adamson said. Dioxane was found at 34 sites on the EPA's list of high-priority cleanup sites as of 2016, but agency officials said it may be present \”at many other sites.\” The RACER sites are not included on that list, but the Adam's Plating Superfund Site — next door to the Lansing Township RACER properties — is. Another high-profile dioxane site is in Washtenaw County. The plume has contaminated multiple aquifers, according to the City of Ann Arbor, and is moving toward the Huron River. The city has had to shut down one of its wells and some Scio Township residents have had to stop using their well-water systems, Michigan Radio reported in 2017. Dioxane isn't a new chemical, but it's not part of most routine environmental testing, Adamson said. \”It’s not a regulated compound in the same way a lot of the chlorinated solvents are,\” he said. \”There’s no federally enforced drinking water standard for 1,4 dioxane, and it’s those drinking water standards that a lot of times drive the cleanup for contaminated sites.\” Scientists who specialize in cleaning up pollution are \”at our infancy\” in understanding how to deal with dioxane, he said. The chemical was a surprise to the RACER scientists who found it in 2012, Favero said. After detecting it in one well, they continued testing so they could map the pollution plume. Scientists and engineers spent years looking for a fix once they realized it was widespread underneath the property. \”It's a very complex situation there,\” he said. \”It hasn't been straightforward to identify an appropriate technology to deal with the 1,4 dioxane plume.\” Adamson agreed. A lot of pollution can be cleaned by digging contaminated soil out of the ground, but that won't work with dioxane because it likes to spread through water instead of soil. Scientists could pump out the groundwater, but it would take astronomical amounts of work, space and money, he said. \”If these sites were easy to clean up we'd put ourselves out of business,\” he said. Instead, scientists have to come up with a way to treat the water while leaving it underground. That's where biosparging comes in. Scientists set up a pilot project to test whether biosparging will work. The pilot project looks simple — a barbecue-sized propane tank in a fenced storage container, with three narrow pipes extending into the ground. The results are promising, Favero said. Samples taken around the biosparging wells show concentrations of dioxane in the water are dropping. Here's how it works: The system injects air and a small amount of propane into the contaminated water 80 feet below ground. Bacteria that are naturally present in the environment liketo eat the propane, and they turn 1,4 dioxane into carbon dioxide and water while they munch. \”They're going after the propane,\” Favero said. \”The 1,4 dioxane is kind of like salt on the main course.\” Biosparging has been done on other dioxane plumes, like one under an Air Force base in California, but it's rare. If the state approves, RACER scientists and engineers will install biosparging wells starting this year and finish in 2020. Favero doesn't have an exact cost estimate, but expects the cleanup project will cost more than RACER has set aside for typical expenses at the Lansing Township sites. \”We do expect that we will need money from what was established in the settlement agreement called a 'cushion fund,'\” Favero said. \”Everyone recognized the cost estimates were put together... pretty quickly to facilitate the bankruptcy, so there was a cushion fund established for certain conditions.\” It also won't be a quick clean-up. Engineers plan to build 60 biosparge wells and say it could take 6 to 12 years to fully clean the water. Dioxane-contaminated water would have to run through treatment zones three to four times before it would become safe. Pollution that has spent decades underground can't be cleaned in a day, Adamson said. \”It's a pretty big challenge, sort of a difficult contaminant to treat,\” he said. \”It's required a lot of work to get to this point, and it's probably going to take a lot of work to get to the point where they feel like they've cleaned the site up and can walk away from their obligation.\”", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("KALAMAZOO, MI -- A steel products manufacturer is seeking a change in Kalamazoo County’s sanitary code to prevent the use of groundwater near its Kalamazoo Township facility. An existing contamination plume of vinyl chloride caused from historic releases of material has migrated off property owned by Borroughs Corporation at 3002 N. Burdick St. The Kalamazoo County Board of Commissioners will consider creating a groundwater use restriction zone around nine parcels between North Burdick Street and the Kalamazoo River to block the use of groundwater wells. Kalamazoo County Environmental Health Director Vern Johnson said a survey of the area revealed there are no groundwater wells in use. Johnson said there doesn’t appear to be any immediate threat to public health, but the restriction zone would prevent any future wells from being drilled. Borroughs Corp. President and CEO Tim Tyler said the company has spent around $5 million to clean up contamination in conjunction with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. The company manufactures a wide variety of storage equipment products and follows environmental standards set by the International Organization for Standardization, he said. \“Michigan is a wonderful state where we need to protect the environment with everything we have,\” Tyler said. \“We’re not going to do anything that is going to (cause) harm. We want this thing brought to closure.\” Johnson said an underground storage tank removed from the site in 1983 was found with several holes in it, indicating chemicals had been leaking into the soil and groundwater \“for some time.\” Harn said the storage tank contained material used for cleaning and degreasing metal. When released into the environment, Harn said, the chemical was broken down by bacteria and organisms in the soil and degraded into vinyl chloride. The vinyl chloride was not released by Borroughs Corp., Harn said. The cleaning chemicals that were in the tank broke down in the environment and became vinyl chloride, he said. Tyler said the site has inherited contamination migrating from other nearby industrial facilities. Borroughs Corp. has existed at the Burdick Street facility since 1947, Tyler said, though his family didn’t take ownership until 1991. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a maximum contaminant level of 2 parts per billion of vinyl chloride for public drinking water supplies. Johnson said the latest results taken from monitoring wells found between 2 ppb and 4 ppb. \“The cleanup has made a significant difference,\” he said. The vinyl chloride plume migrated southeast toward the Kalamazoo River, said David Harn, assistant supervisor of the DEQ Kalamazoo District Office. Harn said the proximity to the river is having an effect on the flow of groundwater, but the plume is not expected to migrate any further. Remaining contamination will be left to biodegrade naturally, Johnson said. Vinyl chloride in water or soil evaporates rapidly if it is near the surface, according to the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The groundwater use restricted zone would be the fourth in Kalamazoo County, if approved by the Board of Commissioners. Johnson said it could take several months to review documents submitted by Borroughs Corp. The county and an independent engineering firm will conduct similar studies of the plume to compare with the company’s findings. Most of the vinyl chloride produced in the United States is used to manufacture plastic and vinyl products including pipes, wire and cable coatings, and packaging materials. Short-term exposure to high levels of vinyl chloride in air has resulted in central nervous system effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and headaches in humans. Chronic exposure inhalation and oral exposure in humans has resulted in liver damage and increased risk of cancer.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("Detroit public schools expect to spend nearly $3.8 million enacting a long-term solution to widespread lead and copper contamination in students' drinking water. The price tag includes $741,939 to install 818 hydration stations and filters, $750,000 for water coolers until completed installation of the stations in the summer of 2019, $539,880 for environmental remediation costs, $1.2 million for maintenance services and $282,000 for facilities maintenance, according to a resolution passed unanimously by the Detroit Community Schools Board on Tuesday, Oct. 9. It's estimated there will be one hydration station per 100 students in a district of nearly 50,000. Nearly $2.4 million of the cost is being offset by donations from nonprofits and businesses. See the full list of donors. The district last month announced that water samples taken from 57 of 86 schools revealed copper or lead levels in excess of legally acceptable limits. Mass drinking water problems were discovered in at least 33 of 52 schools when test results were returned just prior to the start of the 2018-2019 school year. Results prompted administrators to install water coolers and offer bottled water to students as they returned to class in September. Detroit Public Schools Community District Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Associated Press it would cost an estimated $100,000 per month to provide water to students. A list of schools that tested for high levels of copper or lead can be found here. The high lead and copper levels detected at the schools have been attributed to aging school infrastructure, and not the source water system, according to the Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) and the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. Hydration stations, such as those scheduled to be installed in Detroit schools, are currently used in Royal Oak, Ann Arbor and Birmingham schools, according to the district,","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("ROCKFORD, MI — Under the topsoil at the 15-acre site where Wolverine World Wide spent a hundred years using vast amounts of chemicals to convert animal hides into leather, high levels of volatile contaminants like vinyl chloride and trichloroethylene can be found. Toxic metals like mercury, chromium and lead are confirmed at high levels in the groundwater and sediment in the adjacent Rogue River, including at the spot where people regularly launch canoes and kayaks alongside the heavily-used White Pine Trail. Extremely high levels of PFAS are bleeding into the river. The findings are detailed in a new report submitted in January to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which was obtained by MLive through the Freedom of Information Act. The report is the first comprehensive accounting of contamination at Wolverine’s former tannery, which was demolished nine years ago with minimal pollution testing. State and federal regulators are expected to share highlights from the report during a 6 p.m. townhall meeting Tuesday evening in the Fine Arts Auditorium at Rockford High School. The report clarifies the extensive contamination under and around the tannery site, but does not delve into future cleanup actions, which regulators say have been proposed by Wolverine but which are still under evaluation because health authorities have yet to weigh-in. The new data comes from a summer of testing at the tannery under the supervision of Jeff Kimble, an on-scene coordinator with the EPA Region 5 office in Chicago. Kimble approved the report, which was drafted by Wolverine’s environmental consultant, Rose & Westra GZA. He said state and federal toxicologists are assessing the public health risk posed by the contamination and that evaluation will take a few months to complete. Kimble said that testing didn’t uncover contamination levels that warrant emergency removal action, but it’s nonetheless likely that some actual site work to reduce the exposure risk posed by possible contact with contaminated water, soil and sediment may be needed this year. Whether that work involves removing contaminated soil or sediment, adding fencing to keep people away from dangerous areas, or some kind of site capping with clay or additional topsoil is still being determined. Proximity to the White Pine Trail and the nearby recreational areas on the river is a complicating factor, he said. \“Yes, there’s stuff there that’s not an emergency risk, but there’s some associated risks we don’t want to leave out there for a longer process,\” Kimble said. The report shows several contaminants above state or federal action levels mean to protect against physical human contact or the polluting of surface waters by tainted groundwater. The report shows high levels of hexavalent chromium, between 60,000 and 90,000 parts-per-billion (ppb), in soils north of Rum Creek alongside the White Pine trail where piles of leather scraps still litter the riverbanks from apparent use as fill during tannery operations. Nearby, soil under a paved area between the existing Wolverine shoe depot store and the trail is contaminated by lead between 2.5 million and 11 million-ppb. Under the former wastewater treatment plant peninsula, mercury in the soil is between 100,000 and 180,000-pbb, which is well above the EPA regional removal level. In groundwater, hexavalent chromium under the former tannery building footprint tested between 21 and 40-pbb. A sample of chloride in the groundwater behind the post office, which abuts the southern property boundary, reached 9.7 million-ppb. Much of the site groundwater shows high levels of PFAS, a family of chemicals that Wolverine used in 3M Scotchgard to waterproof shoe leather. The chemicals were detected in virtually all samples taken. In areas along the river south of Rum Creek, Total PFAS levels in the groundwater reach 451,000 parts-per-trillion (ppt). Wolverine’s use of PFAS at the tannery and disposal in sludge waste dumps around the Rockford and Belmont area have contaminated many local drinking water wells. That 2017 discovery helped spark Michigan’s recent focus on finding PFAS contamination statewide. In the Rogue River, a surface water sample next to the site tested at 1,200-ppt for the individual PFAS compound PFOS, which was once the key ingredient in Scotchgard. That exceeds the state’s enforceable PFOS limit of 12-ppt in surface water by 100 times. In river sediment by the kayak launch, testing found arsenic at 100,000-ppb, vanadium at 32,000-ppb, mercury at 30,000-ppb, hexavalent chromium at 8,100-ppb and cyanide at 600-ppb. High levels of volatile compounds like MEK, acetone, carbon disulfide and methelyne chloride were also found in river sediment. Lead in Rum Creek sediment tested at 110,000-ppb. Aside from chemicals, other evidence of the tannery’s impact on the river were noted in the report. At nine locations downstream of Rum Creek, \“hair-like fibers\“ from decades of shaving animal hides were found at various depths while sediment sampling. The test results come as no surprise to the group of Rockford citizens who spent years gathering evidence that prompted the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to begin looking for PFAS at the tannery and Wolverine’s dump on House Street in Belmont. A.J. Birkbeck, an attorney who represents the group, the Concerned Citizens for Responsible Remediation (CCRR), said the test results closely match concern areas the group identified by interviewing former tannery employees and FOIA-requesting documents. The group originally petitioned for EPA’s involvement in 2011 out of concern that the tannery demolition had disturbed the site and exacerbated contamination entering the river. Lynn McIntosh, a Rockford activist, spearheaded that effort. She said working with the city of Rockford and the DEQ to get data on the tannery was \“like heaving boulders out of the way,\” both before and after the EPA, bowing to pressure from city and state officials, left the site under DEQ oversight in 2012. McIntosh closely documented the demolition and spoke to former tannery employees who helped her identify problem areas like “the pit,” a 50-foot former maintenance basement area where toxic waste pooled and sometimes overflowed. She said Wolverine avoided pollution scrutiny during demolition by razing the site on its own dime rather than performing testing the state required to get tax incentives. Aspects of the demolition still raise questions, she argues. Toward the end of demolition, on Aug. 23, 2011, McIntosh photographed excavators loading contaminated soil and concrete debris from the wastewater plant area into trucks that she followed to the Rusche gravel pit in Algoma Township. She said the pit wasn’t licensed to accept hazardous waste, but her evidence sat for years in the hands of state regulators and never resulted in any enforcement action. McIntosh and fellow group members did not identify PFAS as a potential problem with the tannery and Wolverine’s dumping for another several years after the complex was demolished. \“When I saw that debris go to an unlicensed gravel pit, I was horrified,\” she said. \“That’s what kept me going. That is so wrong. How could they get away with that?\” Upon reviewing the new tannery report, McIntosh wasn’t surprised to see high detections of hexavalent chromium in the site groundwater correspond with the location where former workers say Wolverine stored chromium in large tanks inside the tannery complex. \“I feel grateful the EPA has been able to get this data, even if it took 9 years,\” she said. Thad Beard, Rockford city manager, had not seen the new report, but said he’s been getting progress updates on the investigation work. He said the data \“validates\” concerns expressed by citizens. Beard said that, despite the environmental scrutiny of late, he’s fielded a few inquiries in the past couple years from potential developers interested in the site, which abuts a bustling downtown district. \“Hopefully, now that data is available, it leads to action that will protect the public and the environment,\” Beard said. The city would like to see that \“lead to conversation about what the site can be once it’s redeveloped and what is the best long-term use.\” Wolverine declined to comment on any plans or preference for redevelopment at the site. In 2011, the company canceled plans to build a big shoe store on the property. In a statement to MLive, Wolverine said it is developing a plan to intercept and treat contaminated groundwater before it reaches the river. The company has already installed several extraction wells at the site and expects to begin operation this year. Wolverine said the granular activated carbon system will treat PFAS and other contaminants in the groundwater. The company did not include those plans in the new report at the direction of EPA, which says it has yet to review or approve them. \“We are currently completing the design and installation of the rest of the system, and expect it will be in place and operating by late summer or early fall,\” Wolverine said. Wolverine said it has proposed adding protective matting and more gravel to the downtown kayak launch. The EPA is also reviewing that proposal. Kimble said it’s too soon to determine next steps at the tannery. The EPA is evaluating both the risk to public health as well as to local ecology, such as fish and wildlife. \“We need to look at all the data and figure out what those levels mean in regards to risk, and also in comparison to our various cleanup levels or triggers for cleanup,\” Kimble said. \“We’ll be looking at the data on sediment in the river at access areas and will compare that to advice we’re getting from our health folks,\” he said. \“Then, we’ll determine if that needs to be addressed this summer or over the longer term.\” Kimble said a similar report on the extent of contamination at Wolverine’s House Street dump is still being finalized.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("WEST OLIVE, MI -- Some residents and environmental advocates are raising alarms about potential drinking water contamination they say may be caused by a nearby coal-fired power plant in West Michigan. Sierra Club officials announced Tuesday that one of four private drinking wells tested near Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal power plant in West Olive was positive for arsenic at levels more than two times higher than federal drinking water standards. \“Long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water can cause several types of cancer and skin disorders and can also increase risks for diabetes and high blood pressure,\” according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Metals like barium, radium, yttrium and lead were also found in the wells but at \“moderate levels\” not violating drinking water standards, Sierra Club officials said. Sierra Club officials hazarded that the tests are only a small sampling and not comprehensive enough to pinpoint a source -- although they believe it could be the now-defunct unlined coal ash pits at the power plant. Consumers Energy disputes the environmental groups’ theory about the source of the contamination. Coal ash is the by-product of burning coal. If not properly managed, it can pollute groundwater with contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic, according to the EPA. Before 2015, utilities were legally allowed to store coal ash in unlined pits, Charlotte Jameson, energy policy and legislative affairs director for the Michigan Environmental Council, said.  Jan O’Connell, development director and energy issues organizer at Sierra Club, said her group has forwarded the test results to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, hoping that state regulators will conduct further and more comprehensive testing. EGLE spokesperson Scott Dean said he couldn’t comment on the data because EGLE officials haven’t seen the test reports. Dean said the location of the wells is important to know, as arsenic is naturally occurring in many areas of the state and associated as well with past farming activity. \“We have an extensive monitoring network and results from sampling for the current and historic disposal areas, plus we have a remedial action plan for the historic disposal area,\” Dean said of the coal plant site. Consumers Energy, in a statement, said the company monitors groundwater at the plant and has no indication of contamination from formerly used coal ash pits migrating off the property. \“Our data indicates no exceedances of arsenic, lead or radium above drinking-water standards migrating beyond Consumers Energy’s property boundary,\” according to Consumers Energy’s statement. \”We will continue to review this information and work proactively with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and our community.\” Jameson argues that Consumers Energy’s own monitoring well data from 2017 shows some on-property migration from the pits of groundwater contaminated with arsenic exceeding EPA guidelines. The testing showed arsenic levels in groundwater four times higher than the EPA’s safe drinking-water standards, she said. \“It’s clear that the Campbell coal plant is responsible for contaminating groundwater and surface water in the vicinity of the plant,\” she said. \“EGLE should fully investigate the area’s drinking water wells to ensure that toxic groundwater contamination throughout Campbell is not polluting drinking water in the area.\” The home with arsenic exceeding federal drinking water standards is located south of the power plant on the south shore of Pigeon Lake. All four homes tested in the area of Pigeon Lake had “moderate” to “low” levels of radium. Two of the homes are north of Pigeon Lake, and the last one is located on its eastern shores. Sierra Club officials declined to give the exact locations, citing privacy concerns.  The Grand Rapids municipal water system’s Lake Michigan filtration plant is located about 4 miles north of the power plant. The plant, which serves about 300,000 people, draws its water about a mile out from shore. Arsenic, lead and radium are not present in the water supply at detectable levels, said Mike Grenier, superintendent of the Lake Michigan filtration plant. Lead is present but in areas of lead service lines and below action levels, he said. Barium is present in the system in minute amounts just above the detection limit and far below drinking water standards. Jameson and O’Connell called on Consumers to shut down the coal power plant sooner than 2040, which is the company’s current timeline, as well as remove all coal ash from the unlined pits. Roger Morgenstern, a Consumers Energy spokesperson, said the company has removed coal ash from every storage pond at the power plant. All coal ash currently being generated is either being reused or placed in a double-lined landfill at the power plant site.","CSVtest.csv")

Macomb County workers took action that day after receiving a tip about oil spilling into the Plumbrook Drain, near 19 Mile Road, west of Ryan Road. Crews from the Macomb County Public Works Office reportedly spent the day taking steps to \“contain and absorb\” the substance by setting up booms, or floating barriers. They reportedly searched the area to find where the suspected oil had come from. A photo produced by the county shows a rainbow-streaked sheen upon the drain’s water. In a statement, Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller encouraged people to be \“our eyes and ears\” to rapidly combat pollution. \“Protecting our waterways is our No. 1 priority. It is critical that we respond quickly so we are able to prevent pollutants from making their way into Lake St. Clair,\” she said. The news of the incident did not reach some Sterling Heights officials right away. At around 4 p.m. that afternoon, Sterling Heights Fire Chief Chris Martin said he was unaware of the spill and planned to look into the incident. The city’s community relations director, Bridget Kozlowski, also hadn’t heard about the incident until contacted by the Sentry. Dan Heaton, public relations manager for the Macomb County Public Works Office, said his department typically works with the Fire Department on environmental matters like these, though he added that he \“can’t speak directly to this incident.\” City officials said in a press release dated later that day that they told the Macomb County Public Works Office that a Sterling Heights Department of Public Works crew had used heavy machinery in the area, which might have affected the drain. \“The city of Sterling Heights is investigating whether the heavy machinery malfunctioned causing the discharge of hydraulic fluid and is fully cooperating with the MCPWO,\” the statement reads.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("ROYAL OAK — Interim City Manager and City Attorney David Gillam said he does not want to scare people, but that they should take seriously the public advisory about lead levels in the city’s water issued Oct. 29. Last year, the state modified the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act’s Lead and Copper Rule to make standards for testing more rigorous in order to better detect lead in drinking water.In the last several weeks, testing in communities, including Oak Park, Hazel Park and Birmingham, revealed lead concentrations of more than 15 parts per billion — the concentration deemed “action level” by the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act — in locations with known lead service lines.Testing completed this summer in Royal Oak verified that out of 30 homes with known lead service lines, eight sites exceeded concentration levels of 15 ppb. The water was tested after sitting stagnant in the service lines for a minimum of six hours.The 90th percentile value for samples taken during the latest monitoring period in Royal Oak was 23 ppb.Royal Oak will now increase the frequency of monitoring, as well as the number of sites tested. The city speculates that approximately 6%, or 1,400 service lines, of the city’s 23,741 total service connections were constructed with lead or materials containing lead.\“The condition of the water hasn’t changed from before the testing. The source of the water hasn’t changed at all,\” Gillam said. \“The water that runs through our mains does not have lead. It becomes a problem when the water gets into the supply lines between our mains and our residents’ homes and the water sits there for a period of time.\”Lead can enter drinking water when it comes into contact with older pipes, solder, interior plumbing, and older fittings and fixtures containing lead, especially when water remains still for extended periods.Gillam said the city has never had a problem since it began testing supply lines known to contain lead in 1992, as mandated by the MSDWA. During the Monday, Oct. 28, City Commission meeting, Gillam said that the state alerted the city of the \“action level\” concentrations of lead late the week before.On Oct. 29, the city launched a series of tools aimed at educating the public about lead and lead testing, which can be found at www.romi.gov/leadtesting. It also trained a five-person team of city employees to operate a dedicated hotline for lead questions at (248) 246-3999.Lead can cause serious health problems if too much enters your body from drinking water and other sources.\“According to the Centers for Disease Control, lead is most damaging to children age 6 and younger and pregnant women,\” Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for Oakland County, said in a prepared statement.In the public advisory for drinking water customers in Royal Oak, the city listed a number of recommended actions for all residents to take to reduce exposure to lead.The more time water has been sitting in your home’s pipes, the more lead it may contain. Therefore, if your drinking water has not been used for several hours, run the water before using it for drinking or cooking. This flushes stagnant water from the pipes. Additional flushing may be required for homes that have been vacant or have a longer service line; however, the following provides a good guideline.If you do not have a lead service line, run cold water for 30 seconds to two minutes, or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature.If you do have a lead service line, run cold water for at least five minutes to flush water from the plumbing of your home and the lead service line.The Michigan Department of Health recommends that any household with a child or a pregnant woman use cold water and a certified lead filter to remove lead from their drinking water, especially when preparing baby formula.Look for filters that are tested and certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 53 for lead reduction. Be sure to maintain and replace the filter device in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions to protect water quality.Filters cost about $35, replacement cartridges cost about $15, and each has an approximately nine-month lifespan, according to the city.The advisory says not to use hot water for drinking, cooking or preparing baby formula, and it notes that boiling will not reduce the amount of lead in water. Residents also should clean their faucet aerators to remove trapped debris.If you are unsure whether your home has a lead service line, visit www.romi.gov/leadtesting to take a test with photos to determine the service line material.An online feature is available in which residents can email a photo of their water meter and some of the pipe supply line on each side of the meter to the Royal Oak Department of Public Service, and the DPS will identify if it contains lead.Residents also can drop off a photo at the DPS building, 1600 N. Campbell Road, just south of 12 Mile Road.Have your water tested for lead. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy publishes a list of state laboratories that are certified for lead testing at michigan.gov/mileadsafe. The Oakland County Health Division also offers testing kits. For more information, contact the Oakland County Health Division at (248) 858-1280.\“This is something that we’re going to be talking about at this table for years and years and years,\” Gillam said. \“The legislation is clear that it’s our obligation to replace the lines.\”He said a number of communities have joined together and challenged the new regulation on various grounds, the biggest being that the state is requiring municipalities to replace the service lines without providing funding to do so.\“That the standards have changed is a good thing, because that allows us as homeowners and a community to be much more aggressive and proactive in getting rid of those lead service lines or applying filters before it becomes a serious health hazard,\” Commissioner Kyle DuBuc said. \“Ultimately, what has to happen is those lead services lines have to come out.\”The city has slowly been building a database to chart what materials service lines are made of when discovered during city projects, but officials hope to dramatically increase the database with reports from residents.As of press time, more than 900 residents had performed the test to find out what material their water services lines are made of and reported their results to the DPS. The website had more than 10,000 hits, and the hotline received more than 300 calls.\“This is going to be expensive. And it’s something we are going to have to do,\” Oakland County Board of Commissioners Chairman Dave Woodward, D-Royal Oak, said in a prepared statement. \“Now is the time for bold leadership. Protecting our drinking water is a public health priority, and we will work with our local communities, families and residents to solve this challenge together.\”","CSVtest.csv")

Other practices that should never be done are pouring it down a drain or walking through it, which can contaminate shoes and spread the mercury. EGLE investigators will inspect the scene Friday night, then \“determine next steps and ensure the site is properly secured,\” the release said. Court records show that Sayers had planned to sell the property, and he may have done so by now, as part of his sentencing in November. Sayers began serving a one-year prison sentence a week ago, at the federal penitentiary in Morgantown, West Virginia, according to federal prison records. He also owes the government $1.5 million to cover the cost of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup of his factory in 2017-18. Sayers pleaded guilty last year to a charge of improperly storing hazardous chemicals, after city, state and federal authorities had requested in vain for two decades that he comply with environmental laws. Test results from EGLE showed elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a group of poisons known overall as PFAS, according to a news release. The water sampled from Sayers’ basement pit contained levels of PFOS — one of the PFAS compounds — at a level of 742 parts per trillion, more than 10 times above Michigan’s groundwater standard of 70 parts per trillion.Before Friday’s disturbing test results were released, pollution fighters with powerful pumps at the site removed a tanker truckload of polluted water, all of it turned a sickly green by exposure to cancer-causing chromium-6 chemicals. The cleanup at Electro-Plating Services drew national attention when motorists on Dec. 20 saw green effluent spurting from a crack in a retaining wall of the freeway just north of Detroit. That night and the following day, a crew hired by the EPA began sucking up more than 11,000 gallons of polluted rain and groundwater from inside and beside the vacant factory. EPA officials said Friday that at least two workers will be on the site this weekend, day and night, maintaining pumps that will continue removing contaminated liquid during rainfall expected Friday night and Saturday.EGLE officials stressed that any PFAS contamination that may have flowed from the site into storm sewers, and thence into Lake St. Clair, is not a concern for southeast Michigan's drinking water intakes. Six rounds of drinking water intake testing showed either no detections for PFAS, or very low levels. \”All results are below both the existing EPA advisory level and below Michigan’s proposed new drinking water standards,\” officials said in the EGLE release.Drinking water systems that draw water from Lake St. Clair include Mount Clemens, Ira Township, Grosse Pointe Farms and New Baltimore. Detroit’s far bigger system, serving millions across southeast Michigan, draws much of its water from an intake pipe at the head of the Detroit River, where Lake St. Clair narrows.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("It's not supposed to be like this.Though advisories about toxic mercury in fish have continued in Michigan and the surrounding Great Lakes, with recommendations to limit consumption of certain species to a few times per month, the amount of mercury found in fish tissues has dropped steadily over decades since the 1970s. That corresponded with the reduction of pollution coming from Midwestern smokestacks as regulations tightened, pollution prevention technology improved, and coal-fired factories and power plants went offline.But over the last several years, that started changing. Scientists are finding mercury levels rising in large Great Lakes fish such as walleye and lake trout. Curiously, it's occurring with fish in some locations but not others. Researchers are still trying to figure out why. The mercury levels are not surpassing U.S. Environmental Protection Agency thresholds. But researchers want to determine if what they are seeing is a temporary trend or a trajectory that's only going to worsen. The answer has large ramifications for Michigan's vital sports fishing industry. Anglers spent $2.4 billion in trip-related expenses and equipment in 2011, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.Mercury is a heavy, silvery metal, unusual in that it's liquid at room temperature. It's naturally occurring, but is rare to find uncombined with other elements.It's very toxic to humans and animals — and unlike many other toxins, mercury remains in the environment for very long periods of time, moving up the food chain and compounding inside animals that ingest it. The EPA has found mercury in water has the potential to cause kidney damage from short-term exposures at levels above the maximum contaminant level of just 0.002 parts per million. Mercury can inhibit brain development in fetuses and children, and harm immune systems and adult heart function.Environment and Climate Change Canada, a similar agency to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, looks at data collected from multiple fish species and herring gull egg monitoring across the Great Lakes. One of the survey sites for gull eggs is on Canada's Fighting Island, in the Detroit River near Wyandotte, said Agnes Richards, a research scientist with Environment Canada.\”We've been monitoring since the 1970s, and the (mercury contamination) trends overall have been declining — as have been the emissions of mercury into the atmosphere and deposition into the lakes,” she said. ”We decided to look at recent trends, from 2000 to 2015. What we found is, at some specific sites, trends have reversed.\” The researchers published a finding of their studies in late December.The issue has been noticed on the Michigan side of the Great Lakes as well.\”Out of 19 data sets, we see eight where we can see a significant trend\” of mercury levels rising in certain fish, said Joseph Bohr, aquatic biologist for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality's Water Resources Division, which does its own fish monitoring.On Lake Michigan, walleye and lake trout from Grand Traverse Bay show increases, Bohr said. On Lake Huron, walleye from Saginaw Bay and lake trout from Thunder Bay have rising levels. Mercury levels in Lake Erie walleye have also risen. The average rate of increase is about 2% per year in the fish, he said. But at least for now, the mercury spikes are in isolated locations.\”We have 11 other data sets where we're not showing any significant increase,\” Bohr said.Scientists only have hypotheses regarding why this is occurring. The trend of warming Great Lakes could be a factor, said Shane De Solla, an ecotoxicologist with Environment Canada and co-author on the recent study.Many types of mercury in the environment tend to pass through fish when ingested. But a type known as methylmercury tends to be absorbed into fish tissues. As small fish eat contaminated insects, and medium-sized fish eat the smaller fish, and large game fish eat the medium fish, those mercury concentrations get magnified exponentially, a process known as bioaccumulation.\”The lakes are slightly warmer, and that increases the production of methylmercury,\” De Solla said.The region's more frequent and intense storms in recent years could also be a factor, Richards said.\”That results in a lot of flooding, and the re-suspension of sediments,\” she said. \”What was buried before can become exposed, and that can increase the conversion of mercury to methylmercury.\”And invasive species in the Great Lakes likely also play a role.\”It's really significantly changed the food web,\” Bohr said.The timelines for the explosion of invasive zebra and quagga mussel populations in the Great Lakes, as well as the round goby, a small fish, rather neatly correlate with the reversal of declining mercury levels in sport fish, he noted.\”You can't just ignore that,\” he said.Further evidence of invasive species' disruption of fish diets as a possible culprit for the mercury mystery comes from carp. In Grand Traverse, Saginaw and Thunder bays, unlike walleye and lake trout, carp aren't showing rises in their mercury levels, Bohr said. From the St. Clair River, through Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River, carp are even showing decreases in mercury, he said.That's significant, because bottom-feeding carp are eating different meals than the large sport fish.\”They're  low on the food chain,\” Bohr said. \”They're just mucking around on the bottom eating insects, basically.\”De Solla said he doesn't \”see anything catastrophic in the next little while.\” But if the mercury numbers do continue to increase in Great Lakes fish, \”it could become a problem again.\”That highlights the importance of continued monitoring, Richards said, \”to see if this is a slight oscillation or a growing trend.\”That could be jeopardized on the U.S. side, as President Donald Trump's 2017 budget proposal calls for elimination of virtually all Great Lakes restoration funds.Bohr said most of the DEQ's work to evaluate toxins in fish is done through state funding. But, \”indirectly, any federal budget cuts are likely to have an impact,\” he said.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("DETROIT — State regulators say 91,000 bushels of soybeans must be destroyed, three years after just a small portion was grown on land that had sediment from a Kalamazoo River Superfund site in western Michigan. Only 145 bushels were harvested from the land. But here’s the problem: Those soybeans were stored with thousands of additional bushels, likely worth more than $800,000 in fall 2016. The agriculture department said the soybeans are indistinguishable and can’t be sorted. \“That has magnified the ramifications,\” Brad Deacon, director of legal affairs at the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, told The Associated Press. \“The unfortunate part is they were comingled with perfectly good grain from other farms.\” Since 2016, the soybeans have been locked up under state order in Hamilton in Allegan County. The 145 bushels were grown by Golden Grain Farms and sold for $1,300 to CHS, a global Minnesota-based farm cooperative with operations in Michigan. CHS recently filed a lawsuit against Golden Grain, seeking unspecified compensation for all 91,000 bushels and disclosing details about the unusual controversy. Golden Grain didn’t return messages this week seeking comment. CHS declined to comment. Soybeans, which are high in protein, are typically turned into animal feed. But they’re also used to make oil and food for human consumption as well as biodiesel fuel. The soybeans harvested by Golden Grain were grown on land that couldn’t be used for farming, according to state regulators. The restriction was in place because dredged spoils, or sediment, from the Kalamazoo River had been placed on the land. The river was contaminated for years by polychlorinated biphenyls, also known as PCBs. CHS’ lawsuit quotes Golden Grain owner Tom Brink as saying that growing soybeans on the soil was the \“biggest mistake\” of his life. Nonetheless, CHS and Golden Grain repeatedly reached out to the agriculture department to try to come up with a compromise. In a 2017 letter, Golden Grain’s lawyer said there was no direct evidence that the soybeans were contaminated and any pollutants in the ground were insignificant.The state, however, wasn’t swayed. Federal regulators supported the agriculture department.\“The soybeans are not fit for human or animal use and destruction is the only viable path,\” Deacon told CHS in June.CHS has proposed sending the beans to a landfill or burning them.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("Barbara Godwin-Chulick said she lived for more than a decade in her home at 230 Antrim St., thinking it was free from dangerous chemicals caused by the former dry cleaners that had operated in that location.According to Godwin-Chulick, she received a knock on her front door from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) telling her of the remaining dangerous toxins only a few years ago.\“I feel like I am at the mercy of the EPA,\” she said.She was advised the government had been wrong in their past assessment of her property. There were still hazardous pollutants in the ground underneath her home, stated Godwin-Chulick.As previously reported by Michigan Radio, a portion of downtown Charlevoix has been categorized as a Superfund site. The EPA is currently in the process of developing a plan to eliminate the remaining ground contaminants in the downtown Charlevoix area.A \“Superfund site\” is any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment. These sites are placed on the National Priorities List.The contaminated downtown area had been categorized as a federal Superfund site in 1984-85. At that time, the EPA decided the best remedy was to let the groundwater \“naturally attenuate\” and in the meantime, move Charlevoix to a Lake Michigan water supply.The site was then taken off the National Priorities List in 1993. A city ordinance that bans drinking water wells was put into effect, and for more than a decade, those restrictions were considered adequate to protect public health.Then, in 2011, the EPA concluded there was a vapor intrusion risk. The groundwater wasn’t self-cleaning like officials had anticipated it would.As also previously reported, the EPA found samples in August of 2012 above federally accepted levels.Godwin-Chulick says she was advised the chemicals were manifesting in the form of vapors and were leaking through cracks in her basement and into her home.Two vapor-eliminating devices were installed by the EPA on the side of her home. The machines were drilled into the ground underneath her basement and now act as a vacuum; sucking up the vapors and emitting them into the air above the home through a long pipe running up the side of the house.The poisonous gas is immediately neutralized when it is combined with the air, says Godwin-Chulick. According to the EPA, once the gas touches the atmosphere, the chemicals are rendered safe.There are an estimated 16 buildings in the city of Charlevoix fitted with the same type of vapor vacuum apparatus, said city officials. One of the buildings is the Charlevoix Montessori Academy school, formerly known as Northwest Academy; which has multiple vacuum systems reaching up the back of the structure at 115 W. Hurlbut St.Godwin-Chulick’s home is one location that has been identified by the EPA as a source point for the chemicals that have been polluting the downtown Charlevoix ground for over 40 years. Another former dry cleaning facility on Garfield Street and a former tool and dye business on Lincoln Street are two other sources cited by the EPA.According to Godwin-Chulick, the local health department made her aware of the hazardous chemicals on her property in 1981, only one year after she purchased it.She was a young woman when she purchased the house in 1980 and had ambitions of a family and a pottery studio in that location. She purchased the property with a land contract from the family that had operated the dry-cleaning business in that location.She said she was not made aware the property could be hazardous to her health upon purchase of the property.However, after she was notified of the ground condition in 1981, Godwin-Chulick and her husband continued to live in the home they had set their dreams on. They raised their two children there. \“And for the last decade we thought it was perfectly safe,\” she said.The building on the property is spacious enough that over the years, mothers-in-law and other family members have shared the home and it did end up being a working pottery studio for a time as well.Godwin-Chulick currently lives there with her daughter and three granddaughters and now rents out space in the building to supplement her income. It is this extra income that allowed her to retire, she said.She says the home is all she has to leave to her children when she is gone.\“I thought this would be their inheritance,\” said Godwin-Chulick. \“I don’t have anything else to give my kids.\”At no time have the family been offered medical assessments or health testing recommendations from the federal, state or local government, said Godwin-Chulick.Most currently, she said she was advised by the EPA the home may have to be demolished in an effort to remove the contaminated ground it sits upon.As the EPA decides its path forward in removing the ground pollutants, there are some unknowns for Godwin-Chulick: What the timeline is; how (and if) she will be financially compensated; and where her family will live during the decontamination process.The EPA is accepting public comment on the proposed cleanup plan involving parts of Charlevoix, and has scheduled an open house for the community from 3-6 p.m. on Jan. 8 at the Charlevoix Public Library.The public comment period will end on Saturday, Jan. 18.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LANSING (AP) — The cleanup of an industrial site in suburban Detroit from which contaminated water leaked last month will likely cost millions of dollars, officials of Michigan’s environmental agency said Wednesday.Tracy Kecskenmeti of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy told Michigan lawmakers efforts to contain the leak at the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site in Madison Heights has cost at least $200,000 over 24 days. She said the presence of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances could triple the cost of removing contaminated water and soil from the site.Electro-Plating Services was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage.EGLE Director Leisl Clark told lawmakers she is \”disappointed\” in what transpired in Madison Heights and the agency is reviewing decisions and processes regarding property owner Gary Sayers.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("WALLOON LAKE — State officials are not expecting any significant long-term effects from a fuel oil leak that was discovered and cleaned up on the southern shore of Walloon Lake earlier this week.Josephine Roberts, executive director of the Walloon Lake Association and Conservancy, said late Tuesday afternoon the organization received calls from neighboring property owners reporting a foul smell and a visible sheen on the water in the Ellis Road neighborhood, which is located on the south shore of the lake's main basin.Roberts said the association responded by reporting the matter to the state's pollution response hotline and 911.Melissa Kendzierski, an environmental quality analyst with the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (formerly the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality), said the call came in around 5:45 p.m., but the message wasn't heard by staff until the following morning.Roberts said crews from the Boyne City Fire Department along with Charlevoix County Sheriff's Office responded to the scene to assist.She said emergency crews determined the source of the problem was oil leaching from an old storage tank that had been removed from a building being dismantled by contractors.Officials called in Statewide Environmental Services to begin cleanup work. Crews used a floating boom to contain oil on the water's surface and began removing contaminated soil from the site.The state environmental agency's Kendzierski confirmed Roberts' information, noting that the information that was relayed to her is that crews were in the process of demolishing an old cottage or lodge on the lakefront property when they encountered a 250-gallon oil storage tank in the basement. She said the information she was provided indicated that as crews were trying to lift the tank out of the basement, ”there was some kind of mishap” and an estimated 2-3 gallons of fuel oil spilled on the floor.She said the floor of the basement contained a drain that led discharges to a nearby embankment about 50 feet from the lake.She said 2 or 3 gallons of fuel oil spilling would not normally be as noticeable as the the spill was outside the building and on the lake surface. She said it is believed that the tank had been leaking for some time and that the pipe leading away from the floor drain had become clogged. She said it's likely that the demolition work at the site dislodged the clog in the drainpipe allowing oil that had been inside to spill out of the embankment.\”There was definitely more than 2 to 3 gallons out there,\” Kendzierski said.She said crews worked at the site through late Thursday removing contaminated soils.Soil samples have been collected and will be sent away for testing. If those tests come back showing contaminant levels below action level, crews will be given the go-ahead to begin site restoration work to prevent erosion.Kendzierski said part of the ongoing testing will include investigation of the soils under the drainpipe to see if any oil was leaking from it prior to Tuesday.She said the long-term effects of the spill should be minimal thanks to the quick action of those who reported and responded to the incident and the fact that — as far as contaminants go — fuel oil is \”not extremely toxic.\”She said the cost for the cleanup effort will be the responsibility of the contractor and/or the property owner.Roberts, the association president, said incidents of contamination spills such as Tuesday's are very rare on the lake. However, she noted that the chances of it happening are increasing.\”There are many antiquated structures around the lake, such as old cottages. When these properties change ownership, often the new owners want to renovate or demolish the old structure and crews will encounter these old storage tanks,\” Roberts said.She added: \”Some contractors aren't always educated about what to do when they come across these tanks — to have the oil professionally removed from the tank before removing the tank.\”Roberts also praised the efforts of the the neighbors who reported the problem and the crews who responded to the situation.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LANSING (AP) — Michigan on Tuesday sued 3M, DuPont and other companies for financial damages from contamination caused by potentially harmful \“forever\” chemicals that are turning up in drinking water across the industrial state.The lawsuitfiled in state court alleges that 17 defendants deliberately concealed the dangers of a class of substances known collectively as PFAS. The filing, announced by state Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, came a year-and-a-half after former Gov. Rick Snyder first stated Michigan’s intent to sue Minnesota-based 3M and other unnamed parties.Michigan is believed to be the third state to file a broad-based suit against multiple manufacturers over PFAS contamination, which has been confirmed at 74 sites and has cost the state at least $25 million annually in recent years for testing and investigations, Nessel said. The compounds, which have been in production since the 1940s, are dubbed \“forever chemicals\” because they take thousands of years to degrade, and because some accumulate in people’s bodies.\“Without widespread investigation, sampling, remediation of state lands and waterways, restoration of impacted natural resources, installation of very costly filtration devices, and other preventative and remedial actions necessary to stop these chemicals from harming our residents and our environment, the presence and migration of PFAS in our state’s natural resources and property will continue unchecked and indefinitely,\” Nessel said, \“threatening natural resources, threatening our property and threatening the lives of our state residents.\”A spokesman for Delaware-based DuPont said \“we are extremely disappointed they have taken this action we believe is without merit.\”\“While fulfilling our remediation responsibilities continue to be a priority for DuPont, we are, and have always been, committed to upholding the highest standards for the well-being of our employees, our customers and the communities in which we operate, and we will vigorously defend our record of safety, health and environmental stewardship,\” Dan Turner said.A message seeking comment was left with 3M. The suit names other companies, too, including some spun off from DuPont both before and after a 2017 merger with Michigan-based Dow ChemicalIn 2018, 3M agreed to pay Minnesota $850 million to settle a case alleging the manufacturer damaged natural resources and contaminated groundwater by disposing of the chemicals over decades.Studies have associated certain PFAS chemicals with increased risk of cancer and damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid. The suit alleges that the defendants knew or should have known that the chemicals persist in the environment and do not degrade, that they would inevitably accumulate and build up in humans and animals, and that it is a potential or confirm carcinogen.\“Companies that are responsible for these contaminants must be held accountable,\” Whitmer said. \“Polluters must pay.\”Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are found in firefighting foam, nonstick pots and pans, water-repellent clothing, and many other household and personal items.Industries have phased out two of the most-studied versions of PFAS.

newsTextToCSV("Residents of southwest Detroit are forced to deal with heavy pollution emitted from the many factories within Southwest and surrounding areas, automobile and semi-truck traffic and other environmental stressors affecting the health of those in the community.There are over 150 sites in southwest Detroit releasing chemicals and particles which result in air pollution. These sites emit dangerous chemicals and particles such as PM2.5, sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and ozone.Zip codes 48217 and 48209 are home to the highest levels of greenhouse gas emissions in the city of Detroit. Moreover, the areas in Detroit with the highest concentration of PM2.5 are also the areas with the highest Latino population.The air pollution in southwest Detroit causes numerous health issues for residents of the community including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, kidney failure and cancer.Asthma hospitalization rates in southwest Detroit and surrounding areas are nearly triple the state average; cancer rates are also higher than average.The International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health reported that air pollution in the Detroit area has led to over 10,000 DALYs (the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability, according to the World Health Organization), in addition to 6.5 billion dollars in economic losses. Moreover, they concluded that about 5.5 percent of annual deaths in the area are due to exposure to PM2.5.\“These particles and chemicals can penetrate our body and enter our bloodstream and wreak havoc on health,\” said Guy Williams, president & CEO of Detroiters Working for Environmental Justice. \“We have only recently realized the serious damage PM2.5 can cause.\”Steve Tobocman, director of Global Detroit and former Michigan state representative, cites the Marathon Oil Refinery, The Detroit Intermodal Freight Terminal, the Detroit Water and Sewerage facility, Zug Island and traffic as main polluters that have led to these health issues.Marathon Oil, located on Fort Street, produces up to 140,000 barrels of oil a day – the site operates 24 hours a day, all year round. In 2014, the oil refinery emitted 430 tons of nitrous oxide, 83 tons of PM2.5 and 211 tons of sulfur dioxide.Williams said the pollutants emitted by Marathon and other factories in southwest Detroit cause terrible outdoor air quality and can get trapped in homes, resulting in poor indoor air quality as well.Health issues potentially caused by pollution is prevalent among the youth living in southwest Detroit. At Munger Elementary-Middle School in southwest Detroit, asthma is the number one reason students miss class, according to Charlotte Moss, a Henry Ford nurse stationed at Munger.Due to high asthma rates in the community, Munger Elementary initiated a six-session program educating students about the respiratory disease and medication.Moss said she encourages children to exercise and play outside, but she is fearful about the contaminated air the children would be breathing.Another school in southwest Detroit, Harms Elementary, faces similar issues regarding pollution, according to Community Schools Coordinator Ana Martinez.\“There are so many factories near Harms, there is so much trash on the streets and there are so many nearby houses deteriorating,\” Martinez said. Adding that the fact that the government is aware of the issues prevalent in southwest Detroit and is yet unwilling to take action in the area is very frustrating. She said she cannot come to terms with seeing the major developments taking place in midtown and downtown, while southwest Detroit – a community she has been a part of for 25 years – continues to deal with very serious problems.\“I am all for the rising up of Detroit and investors investing in our city,\” said Martinez. \“But, don’t just invest in the property, invest in the people who have been here for a long time… Our children deserve better than this.\”Martinez said Harms Elementary makes every effort to assist students in being able to access resources that lead to a healthy lifestyle by offering after-school programs. And although these programs help students when they are at school, healthy habits often are lacking once students get home.With over 23 percent of southwest Detroiters having no access to their own vehicle, their ability to get around town is severely hindered. Martinez cited this issue, in addition to financial hardships, as reasons why many families are not able to access gyms and parks, and enjoy a healthier lifestyle.\“These companies that are polluting our air and causing our health to deteriorate need to be held accountable for the actions they are committing. They should put into the communities as much as they take out,\” said Martinez. \“I think it would be a great idea for the polluting corporations in the area to fund a free gym for the children of southwest Detroit.\”In addition to factories and traffic, the proposed Gordie Howe International Bridge is stirring controversy and is a potential cause for concern among the southwest Detroit community.If the bridge is built, between 324 and 414 houses would be relocated; up to seven places of worship would be lost; between 685 and 920 jobs would be relocated from the Delray area; the Community Health and Social Services Center (CHASS), a major provider of healthcare to the southwest Detroit community would be relocated; three cultural/historic buildings would be destroyed; three parks/recreation centers would be removed; light pollution would be increased; there would be a potential increase in semi-truck traffic and a change in the way southwest Detroiters get around due to permanent road closures near I-75.Semi-truck traffic, in particular, is already a major issue plaguing southwest Detroit – as trucks constantly go through neighborhood streets to reach the Ambassador Bridge. Semi-trucks emit PM2.5 and other harmful pollutants into the air.According to Tobocman, the State of Michigan does not have a role in the development of the new international crossing and it will be up to the Canadian government and whatever operator is chosen to implement policies that mitigate environmental factors.\“Unfortunately, U.S. residents have limited their ability to impact the project when the Michigan Legislature decided it would not be a part of the project,\” said Tobocman. \“We have far less a voice in this important economic asset and potential environmental threat.\”Stephanie Chang, state representative for District 6, said, \“While there will no doubt be increased pollution, both noise and air, during construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, once it is constructed, its freeway-to-freeway connectivity may help to ensure shorter idle time.\”Chang added, \“However, I remain concerned about the pollution because there will be increased traffic due to this bridge.\”Government ActionAlthough the government has been criticized by many for its inaction to enact policy that will reduce the amount of pollution emitted into the air, there have nevertheless been several efforts to do so. The impact of the laws, however, is often debated.For example, the Detroit City Council imposed regulations that bar certain commercial vehicles from idling for over 5 minutes within Detroit city limits. Although Williams praises the effort, he notes that because this rule is hard to enforce, it ends up not impacting any reduction in air pollution.Chang has also introduced and supported bills that focus on environmental issues. These bills include HB 4200, which calls for citizen oversight of MDEQ and HB 4257, which set requirements for the proper and safe storage of pet coke.Chang said she is working on establishing legislation that would \“create a fund that companies who have violated the Clean Air Act would pay into in order to fund air quality improvement projects in communities directly impacted by their pollution.\” This is in addition to a bill that would \“create an ombudsman for air quality who would have the ability to receive and process complaints, initiate investigations and request injunctive relief and prescribe penalties.\”Raquel Castaneda-Lopez, city council member of District 6, said her office is \“beginning work on legislation to create necessary buffers between pollution sources and residential areas, and creating ‘complete streets’ to encourage walking and biking.\” Her office has also worked with the Delray community to try and secure community benefits for those who will be impacted by the Gordie Howe International Bridge.Ultimately, everyone agrees that enacting and implementing policies that protect residents from environmental harm will require cooperation between community organizations, policymakers, and corporations. Competing interest and objectives, however, often make such efforts difficult to achieve.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("FLINT, MI -- A section of sewer at a former General Motors Corp. factory site that is contributing to the release of PFAS into the Flint River will be closed and rebuilt with leak-proof joints in the next phase of PFAS mitigation.RACER, the company that took over the Buick City site in Flint site after GM went bankrupt, spoke about this plan and further testing of the site at public bus tour and meeting Tuesday, Aug. 13. So far, the hunt for PFAS on the 413-acre former Buick City property on Flint’s north side has found the chemicals in groundwater, storm sewers and sanitary sewers. Nine of 13 storm sewer outfalls show readings of a combination of PFOA and PFOS, the types of PFAS regulated in surface water, according to the most recent results updates from Tuesday, Aug. 6.For one of the sites, RACER will abandon a section of the sewer where PFAS is leaking, Grant Trigger, Michigan cleanup manager for RACER Trust, said at the meeting. The section will be closed off and a new sewer will be built with sealed joints that are leak-proof.\“We have a high expectation that that’s going to solve the problem in this area,\” he said.The plan has been sent to city council for review and RACER Trust will be working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the project, he said.An additional meeting will be held in the Fall to field community input on steps moving forward.PFAS was discovered on the property in fall 2018 when RACER consultants added the search for per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals to its work with existing groundwater monitoring wells for cleanup of other chemicals. While all of the locations are downstream of the Flint water plant’s water intake, used several years ago, and did not affect the city’s drinking water, the PFAS amounts are higher than the state allows to reach Michigan’s surface water. The chemicals are connected to cancer and several other adverse health effects, and the state is midway through a plan to regulate them in drinking water.This is the fourth meeting held to address contamination since the site ceased factory operations, and RACER acquired it and other unused GM properties during the bankruptcy and GM reorganization.\“The biggest impact of the bankruptcy was felt in Michigan and this community,\” Trigger said.\“I’m a native of Michigan, I took this job with enthusiasm to help people hurt by the bankruptcy,\” Trigger said during a bus tour held to show residents the scale of the site before the meeting.RACER is charged with cleaning up and finding new uses for the property, and it’s been listed for sale for several years. About 49 acres have been sold, and other pending deals were put on hold while the PFAS situation unfolded.  RACER is working with state and federal regulatory agencies clean up acquired property. The RACER Trust was provided with nearly $500 million to conduct these investigations and cleanups across all RACER-owned sites.The GM Buick City site was granted $35 million of the trust and there is around $25 million left, he said.The discovery of PFAS on the former manufacturing site is the largest challenge facing the trust, Trigger said. In the past 10 months alone, RACER has spent around $1 million to spearhead cleanup.\“Much of the work that we’re doing is ongoing, and we’d like to share the results with you on our way,\” he said during the meeting.Other Flint-area sites dealing with PFAS contamination include the former city landfill at Bishop Airport, Gilkey Creek and the former Coldwater Road Landfill. Long-time Flint resident Dennis Sykes said curiosity is what brought him to the meeting Tuesday.\“I feel like at least RACER is trying to be transparent about what they are doing on the property now, but it still leaves a lot of questions about what was done on the property prior to RACER owning it and no one being held accountable,\” Sykes said.Transparency over state and national government oversight of contamination in past years has not been what it should be, he said.\“The whole thing just seems foul to me,\” Sykes said.","CSVtest.csv")

They discovered gasoline from an unknown source had entered the sewer lines, causing a \“disruption\” that led to several manhole covers being dislodged, according to police.As of 11 a.m., Lapeer police Chief Dave Frisch said authorities were actively working the scene with assistance from Lapeer Fire & Rescue and the city’s Department of Public Works.\“Should there be some type of a spark or something of that nature with the fumes concentration that we have there it could be very serious,\” he said.The entire downtown area was closed to traffic, with barricades erected at Saginaw and Oregon streets, Saginaw and Horton streets, Nepessing and Mason streets, and Nepessing and Saginaw streets along with several other areas. A block south of Nepessing Street, the Lapeer County courthouse building remained open.Gregory Wise, district court administrator, said the courthouse had no plans to evacuate.Normally the decision to evacuate the building would come from the county administrator or chief judge, Wise said, and he hasn’t heard from either of them.Mark Capstick, manager of Lynch and Sons Funeral Directors, said he received a call at 6 a.m. Wednesday morning about the leak from an employee who also serves as a volunteer firefighter.\“He said when I get a chance I’ll come down and check your basement, but if you beat me to it, check your basement. We don’t think it’s gone down as far as the funeral home,\” said Capstick, who purchased the funeral home in 2004 along with wife Katie. \“We’re kind of right at that cutoff line. I just flew in here this morning, and checked it and we are in good shape. No gas smell, no issues ...\”Frisch didn’t know how long the closure would last as of Wednesday morning.\“We’re still in the control mode,\” he said \“We don’t know the extent of the amount of spillage.\” He noted there is a \“very, very large concentration of gasoline\” to the south of Nepessing Street in a lift station, also referred to as a pump house.\“That is where the private contractors are focusing their efforts on,\” said Frisch. \“We believe if we get it controlled there, we can stop anymore from getting into the sewer line.\”When asked about the potential for additional evacuation orders, Frisch said, \“There’s always that possibility,\” adding, \“We feel confident that the evacuations we have in place are meeting the needs of the situation as it’s presenting itself right now.\”He thanked homeowners and businesses for their cooperation, as well as asking them to remain diligent and feel free to speak up if they observe anything out of the ordinary.\“If you smell gasoline in your home, definitely contact us,\” Frisch said.Officials were looking at diagrams in an effort to assess where the flow of gasoline may go, but Frisch said \“you never know for sure.\”\“Our best source would be that homeowner or that business owner making us aware of it,\” he said.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("MUSKEGON TWP., MI – A sewage spill next to Baker College near Muskegon dumped as much as 132,000 gallons of untreated wastewater into a nearby storm sewer and creek on Tuesday. The leak in a sewer force main was discovered around 9:30 a.m. Jan. 28 on Quarterline Road south of Marquette Avenue in front of Baker College in Muskegon Township, said Dave Johnson, director of the Muskegon County Wastewater Management System.The sewage entered a storm drain that dumps into Four Mile Creek, which runs through the campus of nearby Muskegon Community College, Johnson said. The creek was being tested for the presence of E. coli, and a no-contact advisory was expected to be issued, he said.Municipal workers realized that wastewater was seeping out of a crack in the roadway and Johnson was notified around 10 a.m., he said. The wastewater flowed from the crack – created when the leak lifted up the force main and pavement -- into the nearby storm drain and did not pool on any property, Johnson said.Further investigation revealed the leak was on the bottom of the pipe, leading officials to pull back somewhat on the initial estimate that 132,500 gallons spilled, Johnson said. He called that estimate very conservative. Jackson-Merkey Contractors were called in to repair the pipe and roadway. The flow was stopped at 12:05 p.m., though more untreated wastewater spilled from 12:35 p.m. to 1:11 p.m. as workers had to add an additional pump to transfer sewage from a lift station wet well into a tanker, Johnson said.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("WHITING, IN -- A BP incident management team said an initial visual estimate showed between 377 and 755 gallons of crude oil spilled into Lake Michigan when a malfunction occurred at an Indiana refinery Monday, U.S. Coast Guard representatives said. A cleanup team of eight people returned to the shore of BP's Whiting Refinery for three hours Wednesday, March 26. The crew observed \”minimal\” oiling along the shoreline, according to a Coast Guard release. More oil was manually cleaned from the shoreline after crews removed 1 centimeter tarballs from the sand on Tuesday.The company notified the Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana Department of Environmental Management after discovering the spill late Monday afternoon. It's believed a malfunction occurred with a crude oil distillation unit, sending oil into the refinery's cooling water outfall and into the lake.BP representatives said crews have recovered the majority of oil that was visible in the cove-like area along the shoreline between the refinery and a nearby steel mill. Booms and vacuum trucks were used to contain and remove surface oil. Crews also manually collected oil that was pushed to shore by wind.A view from a Coast Guard helicopter Tuesday showed the spill appeared to be contained to the cove area on BP property. Coast Guard representatives said BP's team will continue engineering analyses to determine the exact amount of oil discharged.A spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Environmental Management on Tuesday said the environmental impact appeared minimal and there were no indications that drinking water was threatened.Philip Willink, senior biologist with Chicago's Shedd Aquarium, said Lake Michigan wildlife should not suffer any long-term effects based on information released by BP and the federal agencies handling the spill. Prolonged ice cover on the lake kept many native fish species off-shore, he said.\”Right now the fish are still in deeper water and haven't come back in yet,\” Willink said. \”I think BP kind of got lucky with their timing. If it happened earlier, if (Lake Michigan) was still ice-covered, it probably would have been hard to do something about.\”Fish typically return closer to shore in April, Willink said.Very low levels of petroleum can impact fish and other wildlife, causing birth defects. Willink said the spill sounds minor, but wildlife and environmental experts hope preventative measures are taken. \”Everybody's looking very closely at this,\” he said.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("GRAND RAPIDS, MI — A medical device manufacturer is facing $110,000 in fines related to emissions of a cancer-causing chemical from a sterilization facility near downtown.Viant Medical Inc. will pay the fines under a proposed consent order negotiated with the Michigan Department of Enviroment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE), according to pollution enforcement documents. A public hearing is scheduled next month and EGLE is taking public comment until Oct. 25.Viant, which operates at 520 Watson St. SW across the river from downtown, sterilizes medical devices using ethylene oxide (EtO). State regulators say the chemical has been escaping the facility at troubling levels through doors and vents as \“fugitive emissions.\”Air quality regulators began scrutinizing Viant’s EtO emissions in July 2018 after the chemical was re-classified as a \“known carcinogen\” based on occupational health studies. EGLE (formerly the DEQ) issued four pollution violation notices and says computer modeling shows EtO levels in the ambient air at levels high enough to pose a long-term risk. The invisible and odorless gas is known to cause breast and blood cancers, including multiple myeloma, leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.Disclosure that EtO emissions were found at elevated levels around Viant generated community concern and prompted indoor air testing at the downtown Grand Valley State University Pew Campus. The university said its testing found negligible health risk.The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services reviewed cancer data for 10 census tracts around the Viant facility on the city’s West Side but did not find increased illness rates. The state said there was limited exposure information from which to draw conclusions. Last year, the Kent County Health Department folded Viant into an existing West Side cancer review once environmental regulators began escalating an emissions probe at the facility.According to a 2018 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency national air toxics report developed using 2014 emissions data, downtown Grand Rapids and much of the city’s West Side between I-196 and the Grand River is at elevated cancer risk due to EtO emissions. Viant’s facility is listed as an EtO source under the name Vention Medical.In Kent County Census Tract 27 (in which Viant’s facility is located), the cancer risk is 118 per million people. In tract 19, the risk is 81 per million. In tract 20, the risk is 87 per million. The national average is 32 per million. Viant has disputed EGLE data collection and assessment techniques and has argued there are other EtO sources in the area like car exhaust.Viant will stop sterilizing devices using EtO at the facility by Dec. 31 and stop using EtO there entirely by Jan. 31, 2020 per U.S. Food & Drug Administration requirements, according to EGLE. The company will continue to sample for EtO through February 2020.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed fine amount, which is the result of negotiations between Viant and EGLE. The money would be paid into the state’s general fund.A public hearing is scheduled at Grand Valley’s Eberhard Center on Oct. 23 at 7:30 p.m., preceded by an informational session at 5:30 p.m.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("MADISON HEIGHTS, Mich. (AP) — An industrial site in suburban Detroit from which a greenish stream of contaminated water leaked onto a freeway will be considered for the federal Superfund cleanup program, Michigan officials said Friday. The state Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said an evaluation of the Electro-Plating Services Inc. site will be completed this spring. It will be based on dozens of soil and water samples being taken by the department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The chrome plating company in Madison Heights was shut down by state regulators in 2016 due to mismanagement of industrial waste. An EPA cleanup removed toxic chemicals and contaminated liquids. The leak of bright green goo onto the shoulder of Interstate 696 last month prompted a new investigation. It found high levels of numerous toxins in soil and groundwater at the site, including hexavalent chromium, which is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage. The Superfund program enables EPA to arrange cleanup of highly contaminated sites by requiring polluters to pay for the work or using government funds when responsible parties can't be found. Michigan officials said Friday they also had detected high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in water collected by a sump pump in the facility's basement. PFAS are chemicals used in a wide variety of industrial and household products that have been linked to kidney and liver damage, thyroid disease, fertility problems and low birth weight. The Michigan agency said water sampled from the basement pit contained levels of one PFAS compound, known as PFOS, at a level of 742 parts per trillion, far exceeding Michigan’s groundwater standard of 70 ppt. The environmental department said the recovered water will be treated to remove the compounds and other pollution before disposal.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("GRAND RAPIDS — While state environmental regulators and a company have reached a tentative agreement to stop sterilizing medical devices at a Grand Rapids plant, officials say their work tracking a pollutant from the facility and elsewhere is far from over.On Wednesday night, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) took public comments in Grand Rapids on a proposed consent order with Viant Medical Inc., which has had multiple air pollution violations over the past year.The facility near downtown Grand Rapids is a hub for sterilizing medical equipment and uses ethylene oxide in the process.Last year, the state found the Viant facility was the No. 1 source of concern for ethylene oxide emissions in the state. Elevated levels of the carcinogen have been tested multiple times at and around the facility over the past year. The facility is subject to both state and federal air regulations.\“We obviously took notice,\” Chris Ethridge, a field operations manager in EGLE’s Air Quality Division, said of a recent federal report’s findings about the facility. Modeling analysis done for Viant did show some significant concerns offsite with the concentration of ethylene oxide, particularly in surrounding residential areas.Ethylene oxide is a known carcinogen. The man-made, flammable, colorless gas could increase the risk of developing blood and breast cancers if breathed in over many years. It’s used mostly to make other chemicals and sterilizing medical equipment.Emissions from the Viant facility are now part of a ongoing broader cancer review by the Kent County Health Department.Following a series of onsite inspections and air pollution monitoring as part of an \“escalated enforcement,\” the state and Viant agreed last month to settle compliance violations that would end its medical device sterilization processes by Dec. 31. The company also agreed to pay a $110,000 fine, which critics said Thursday was insufficient. Viant — a global medical device manufacturing company — was formed last year after a merger between MedPlast and an Integer Holdings subsidiary. The company and its predecessors have been at the location for nearly 30 years.The state will continue monitoring emissions around the plant through February.The state Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) also completed a study this year on whether exposure to ethylene oxide was affecting cancer rates in the surrounding area, which included portions of Grand Rapids, Walker and Wyoming. While the state saw fewer cases of breast cancer in women than expected, it found slightly higher cases of multiple myeloma than rates expected in Kent County.Still, the state can’t say definitively based on research limitations whether the plant caused higher rates of cancer, said Laura Abington, an environmental epidemiologist at DHHS.Officials also note the technology limitations in measuring ethylene oxide in the air, a subject gaining increasing attention across the U.S.Since ethylene oxide is not a persistent toxin like lead or PFAS, emissions from the facility won’t linger long in air, water or soil after sterilization stops.However, residents expressed concern about the company potentially continuing sterilization onsite after the agreement. State officials say the company could be hit with fines of up to $10,000 per day if the process continues after Dec. 31.Additionally, state officials said the Viant site sparked a broader look into the sources of ethylene oxide pollution statewide. While Viant was using the most ethylene oxide in the state, \“many\” more medical sterilization operations exist, Ethridge said.He added that across the U.S., ethylene oxide is being detected, even in places without medical device sterilization activity nearby. Ethridge said the state next will look at chemical manufacturing plants as a source of ethylene oxide pollution.\“Clearly something else is contributing to emissions of ethylene oxide beyond just industries using it,\” Ethridge said. \“There’s going to be a lot more to come as we get into the weeds and data to figure out what in particular could be causing the emissions.\”As more facilities, including hospitals, stop medical device sterilization operations because of concerns related to ethylene oxide, Ethridge said that raises additional questions about where devices can be sent for sterilization. It’s currently unclear where facilities who sent their products to Viant will turn to for sterilization.\“The (Food and Drug Administration) is now saying there’s a shortage of medical device sterilization services because so many businesses are getting out of it,\” Ethridge said. \“It’s a bit of a concern to us where the equipment is going to go.\”","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("The thick white foam pouring through a ravine and rolling over a roadway near an I-75 interchange in southwest Detroit seemed scary and mysterious in summer 2018.Police were called, Hazmat crews wore gloves and boots to get samples, and Schaefer Highway was closed for the so-called \“foam events\” over several days in early August. By the time the foam dwindled to a trickle then stopped, the public was told it wasn’t harmful. Officials said the oozing river of foam it may have resulted from construction of a parking lot near Schaefer Highway and I-75 in Melvindale.Neither was true, investigators now say.Laboratory tests confirm extremely high concentrations of PFAS in that foam – and officials still are considering \“several possible enforcement actions\” against more than one \“unnamed parties\” believed to be responsible for foam so copious it stopped traffic on the industrial thoroughfare on the edge of Detroit, just south of Ford Motor Company’s Rouge complex in Dearborn. The investigation trail started with Norfolk Southern Railroad, then went to Marathon Petroleum, which operates the state’s only refinery. Both received violation notices at year-end, but neither appears to be the source.The mystery may be publicly solved this month.\“We think we’ve got a line on it,\” said Stephen Kuplicki of the industrial waste control division of the Great Lakes Water Authority. \“We’ve laid out several possible enforcement actions.\”Clues point to the use of AFFF, or aqueous fire-fighting foam.That conclusion is the result of an environmental \“whodunit\” investigation by the state’s largest water authority.The situation attracted local attention, but it also reflects growing concerns about PFAS contamination and the chemicals’ health effects on state residents.Michigan continues to explore the role of AFFF in PFAS contamination, and it awaits the results of a year-long study by the state fire marshal. Thousands of containers of AFFF made with PFOS, one type of PFAS and called C8, are on the shelves of Michigan fire departments.The dangers of PFAS foam – which results when PFAS combine with both water and a agitating motion - are being elevated in Michigan, with some state health officials already upgrading warnings to \“do not touch.\” The foam had been accompanied by “do not eat” warnings when was found last year in Michigan rivers, including the Huron and Rogue, and on lakes, like Van Etten near Oscoda. Three bills to set limits on AFFF in Michigan were introduced into the state House of Representatives in March, and they’ll be discussed on Tuesday, May 7, during the meeting of the Natural Resources and Outdoor Recreation Committee.The bills would set new reporting standards for departments that use AFFF containing PFAS, along with prohibiting its use in training exercises and setting regulations to protect firefighters exposed to the chemicals.The proposed AFFF legislation is just one among several initiatives in Michigan to change PFAS-related policy based on findings that the chemicals appear more harmful than previously believed. While the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy oversees statewide PFAS detection and enforcement, GLWA is investigating the Melvindale mystery foam because it discharged into its storm sewer system. Water moves from the storm sewers to the waste water treatment plant that the water authority runs for communities across southeast Michigan. That wastewater treatment plant, in turn, discharges to the Detroit River, which is both a drinking water source for Metro Detroit and connected to the Great Lakes.Wastewater processes target biological waste, but they don’t filter for PFAS – the per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals linked to cancer and other adverse health effects. The state regulates the presence of two types of PFAS in surface water used for drinking water, keeping PFOS below 11-parts per trillion and PFOA below 420-ppt. Because the PFAS foam was moving through the wastewater plant, it became responsible to investigate the source – and halt it.Within a week of the so-called \“foam event,\” state officials said it appeared to be the result of a solvent put onto Norfolk Southern property where the railroad had just established a 25-acre asphalt parking lot and foam was found churning in a catch basin.They took tests, and reports indicated they didn’t expect it to be hazardous. But in the meantime, it prompted the railroad to bring a vacuum truck to the property during rain storms \“to intercept the foam leaving the sewer and entering Schaefer Highway,\” according to the state.But while the railroad was forming a mitigation plan to bring an end to the foam, officials determined that no asphalt mixture would contain PFAS.And the railroad traced the foam to \“a previously unknown storm sewer pipe from the property to the west owned by Marathon Petroleum.\” So the trail turned to the state’s only oil refinery, which operates in southwest Detroit.Marathon already had been working with GLWA on reducing the PFOS it was sending into the wastewater treatment plant, with the concentration ranging from 210-ppt to 800-ppt through July 2018 – and as low as 100-ppt since then. That PFAS comes from AFFF chemicals used by Marathon’s on-site firefighters, the company says.In the meantime, the PFAS tests came back on the foam: It tested at a highly concentrated 729,000-ppt of PFOS and 9,000-ppt of PFOA. The numbers were far higher than what previous was found at Marathon.Both Norfolk Southern and Marathon Petroleum received violation notices from GLWA due to the mystery foam and they continue to work on decontaminating the area, officials said.\“That enforcement with both of them is still open and active,\” Kuplicki said.But neither now is believed to be the cause of the foam. Now GLWA is looking at fire-fighting foam as the cause and it may be from a municipal source. Marathon said its investigation also points to AFFF from off-site, with a company representative the foam was used by a municipality at a scrap yard fire in June 2018, and it and traveled through a storm water ditch, eventually reaching Schaefer Highway.Chief Joseph Murray, who runs the consolidated Dearborn and Melvindale Fire Departments, said his department does not stock AFFF that contains PFAS.GLWA’s Kuplicki said he expects more information later this month as officials there determine who else may be involved. \”Everybody’s on the table,\” he said.Meanwhile, the state is still waiting for its comprehensive plan on how to deal with AFFF. The state fire marshal toured several Michigan departments in fall 2018 as officials inventoried how much foam containing PFOS still could be in use. State officials provided no information on where that effort stands today.And the situation on Schaefer Highway elevated the AFFF issue with PFOS across Marathon Petroleum. While the foam may be essential for certain times of fires, the company is changing its policy in Detroit – and maybe elsewhere. \“Marathon has stopped using C8 firefighting foam in Detroit’s emergency response vehicles and in any fire training exercises,\” said spokesman Jamal Kheiry. \“We are evaluating our emergency response activities company-wide.\”","CSVtest.csv")

It’s there where items such as leaves, shredded twigs and kitchen food scraps that residents place in curbside compost bins are turned into decomposed organic material that is then used as nutrient-rich plant fertilizer.Some of it ends up being used as topsoil in city parks, and free compost is available to city residents in the spring, in addition to being sold through city vendor WeCare.Compost samples collected Oct. 25 tested positive for low levels of 13 types of PFAS, ranging from 0.04 parts per billion to 17 ppb, the city stated in a news release Tuesday, Jan. 28, sharing a test-results chart dated Jan. 22.Water samples collected Oct. 25 from two retention ponds at the city’s compost facility also tested positive for 12 types of PFAS ranging from 0.44 parts per trillion to 680 ppt.Water samples are measured in parts per trillion while soil samples are in parts per billion, the city noted. What the city knows so far is included in the fact sheets released Tuesday, city spokeswoman Lisa Wondrash said in an email, saying the city will continue to seek answers to outstanding questions and update information materials.\“At this time, the research on PFAS in compost is extremely limited,\” the city’s news release stated.\“There is no scientifically approved method for how to test PFAS in soil, so while trace amounts were found, there are no established health advisory guidelines for the city or residents to follow. However, we want our customers to be informed of these results and actions we are taking to further reduce contamination.\”The city uses granular activated carbon filters to reduce PFAS levels in the city’s drinking water from the Huron River, which is polluted with the chemicals.PFAS that’s removed is incinerated offsite and destroyed so it’s not reintroduced in the environment, according to the city. PFAS chemicals can be found in household waste and anywhere PFAS-containing products are used, the city’s fact sheet states, noting the city fire department has stopped using PFAS-containing firefighting foam.\“Solid waste facilities, such as landfills and compost sites, routinely receive PFAS-containing items, such as grease- resistant paper, fast food containers, microwave popcorn bags, fertilizer bags, water-resistant clothing, nonstick cookware, cleaning products and stain-resistant carpet,\” the city’s fact sheet states. \“Although these items are prohibited in the city’s compost program, several of these items are routinely and improperly placed in compost carts.\”The compost tests were conducted by an independent lab, city officials said.The city plans to continue to monitor incoming compost for improper materials and expand education to residents about acceptable compost materials.\“While emerging contaminants may continue to be detected, the city’s dedicated staff are prepared to not only face these challenges, but also to remain an industry leader in pioneering solutions,\” the city’s fact sheet states.

There's no indication the contamination is reaching drinking water supplies in the city, Trigger said.Results are still being reviewed, Trigger said, even as RACER plans a pair of community meetings in November to discuss PFAS on its sites and answer questions.The next step for RACER is to see if the contamination is spreading toward the Flint River. The public water intake is upstream of the sewer outfall, he added.The Buick City property had been a factory site for a century before it moved into RACER's control for cleanup and redevelopment after the GM bankruptcy. Cleanup is ongoing, and parcels have been sold to new industrial users.Previous PFAS readings on the property peaked at more than 600 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS, one type of the \”forever chemical\” believed to have been used on site in plating operations and by firefighters using it in foam. Michigan calls for cleanup if surface water contamination reaches 12 ppt.The new locations at Buick City with PFOS are:The old GM wastewater treatment plant on Stewart Avenue, at 4,800 ppt.The former pickling and enameling site just south of Leith Street, at 4,600 ppt.A former assembly/paint area near Hamilton with 4,800 ppt.The building 44 paint shop on Hamilton, north of the new Lear facility: 15,000 ppt. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality is still validating the results, Trigger said, \”but we are not waiting for validation. We need to keep moving because of these levels.\”RACER is collecting more samples near the storm sewer, with results expected back in the first week of November. Four additional monitoring wells will be added to the property starting this week, allowing more groundwater tests.The news coincides with recent testing results that showed PFAS contamination in a residential well near the Coldwater Industrial Land in Genesee Township.Homes on Stanley Road near the long-closed landfill on the property were tested for PFAS, with one reaching a combined 69 ppt for both PFOS and PFOA. That compared to the 70 ppt lifetime health advisory issued by the U.S. Enviromental Protection Agency.\”We're not sure yet that (our property) is responsible for the contamination, but it's in the vicinity of our investigation,\” Trigger said.RACER installed a water treatment system in late October while the county health department considers more testing.The trust continues to search for a long-term solution to the PFAS contamination on the former GM sites, even as it deals with other identified pollution and mitigation steps.\”We want the community to understand that RACER is on top of it,\” said spokesman Bill Callan. \”We know there's a lot of uncertainty and concern ... We just want to be able to assure people that we are going to take care of it.\”","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("PLAINFIELD TOWNSHIP, MI -- A Superfund landfill suspected as a source of fluorinated chemicals polluting a large Kent County water system once accepted toxic sludge from a leather tannery that used those compounds, according to state documents and a man who says he drove the rancid gunk there himself.Earl A. Tefft, 77, of Sand Lake, says that during the mid-1960s, he regularly drove sludge waste from the Wolverine World Wide tannery in Rockford to the State Disposal Landfill at 3954 East Beltline Ave. NE while hauling for a local pickup service. Wolverine once made the iconic Hush Puppies shoe brand in Rockford using Scotchgard, a stain and water repellant that relies on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances known as PFAS, (also called perfluorinated chemicals, or PFCs) as its chemical backbone.PFAS compounds were found in Plainfield Township water in 2013. The system serves about 40,000 customers.”We're tracking the PFAS from State Disposal to see if it's the only source, or a source in the Plainfield Township wells,” said Judith Alfano, site manager with the Superfund section at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.Alfano stopped short of pinpointing Wolverine as the source of PFAS the DEQ says is moving north and downhill through the groundwater toward five township wells at Versluis Park next to the Grand River along Northland Drive NE.In a statement to MLive, Wolverine did not outright dispute the allegation that its tannery sludge was dumped at the landfill, saying that, \”based on a review of available records, Wolverine does not believe it disposed of material at the State Disposal Landfill.\” However, Kent County records state explicitly that Wolverine dumped sludge at the landfill during the years Tefft says he drove it there.Tefft, a former driver for Bell Pick-Up service, says he transported tannery sludge for 13 months in 1965 and 1966 from Wolverine to the landfill on the Beltline, which was operated at the time by Bell Pick-Up, according to the documents.Tefft also drove sludge to a former Wolverine dump site on House Street NE, where a plume of PFAS compounds are polluting private drinking water wells in Belmont.The Belmont contamination was just discovered this spring.Wolverine began using Scotchgard at its Rockford tannery in 1958. A PFAS compound called perfluoroctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the key ingredient in Scotchgard until the fabric protector was reformulated in the early 2000s.PFOS and a sister compound, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA), are no longer manufactured in the United States because of the public health risk. Through studies, exposure has been tied to liver disease, thyroid malfunction, pediatric developmental problems and other endocrine and immune system impacts.Although the Versluis wellfield shut down in 2015, both compounds are still present at low levels in the township finished water supply.Both PFOS and PFOA are also present in House Street wells.Tefft said he also \”occasionally\” drove sludge to a dump site near the Rogue River on 12 Mile Road next to what's now a White Pine Trail staging area in Algoma Township.In a statement, Wolverine says it is \”not aware of a disposal site at 12 Mile and the White Pine Trail, but is reviewing relevant records.\” Records identify the property as the \”Stowell Gravel Pit\” owned by Kent County.Sara Simmonds, environmental health director at the county health department said, \”we have heard lore of a site in this area but have never been able to pinpoint it.\”Tefft said Wolverine's manufacturing process generated solid and liquid waste that was mixed together on-site into a sludge he picked up daily. Sludge was loaded into Dumpster-like containers and driven through Rockford on a flatbed truck, he said. The containers had no cover and sometimes spilled onto the road.At the landfill on the Beltline, Tefft dumped the sludge into an unlined, dirt-bottomed pit with other garbage. He also drove sealed metal drums of an unknown waste to the landfill.Tefft said the sludge smelled like \”rancid bacon.\”According to records now in possession of the DEQ, the Kent County Health Department cited the landfill for improperly compacting refuse with dirt, lacking procedural plans and generating nuisance odors from accepting tannery waste. \”Your method of discharging liquid into a pond and then filling the pond with rubbish and garbage is not satisfactory,\” former county chief sanitarian W.L. Ettesvold wrote in an Aug. 9, 1966 letter to Bell Pick-Up owner John Douthett.Ettesvold wrote that the landfill must temporarily stop accepting tannery waste until better disposal practices were enacted.\”We wish to also make it a matter of record that the disposal site is not approved for taking the sludges and liquid wastes from the Wolverine World Wide. Inc. because our observations have revealed that the disposal of the material at this site creates a public nuisance,\” Ettesvold wrote on in a follow-up letter dated Nov. 21, 1966.It's unknown whether the landfill accepted tannery waste after 1966.Today, the State Disposal Landfill is owned by Waste Management Inc. through a subsidiary.Jim Forney, regional director of closed sites for Waste Management, confirmed that Bell Pick-Up was the original landfill owner/operator.Plainfield Township discovered PFAS compounds in its water supply after they were added to the 2013 list of unregulated contaminant testing required by the Environmental Protection Agency. The pollutants were traced to Well Field No. 3, a backup field located at Versluis Park on the manmade Versluis Lake. The wells are about two miles north of the landfill.In the early 1990s, many homes downgradient of the landfill were connected to municipal water after volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the landfill were found in the groundwater. Plainfield later built new well fields west of Northland Drive.This year, PFAS levels in Plainfield's finished water supply have fluctuated slightly in samples from the township water plant.In March, PFOS sampled at 5.2 parts-per-trillion (ppt). In June, it was 6.6-ppt. In March, PFOA was at 2.5-ppt. In June, it was 3.4-ppt.The EPA considers 70-ppt to be the benchmark at which chronic exposure to PFOS and PFOA is considered unsafe, although university studies put the safety threshold much lower. In 2015, researchers at Harvard School of Public Health and the University of Massachusetts-Lowell pegged 1-ppt as the safe level of PFOA in drinking water.Levels of PFAS in finished Plainfield water are down overall since 2013, when treated water sampled at 50 and 60-ppt, respectively, in June and September of that year. Toxicant levels in raw, untreated water sampled from inside the Versluis wells have remained steady or dropped over the past year. In March 2016, PFOS hit 710-ppt and PFOA hit 120-ppt in Well No. 3. In October, PFOS tested at 530-ppt, and PFOA at 110-ppt.Raw water has not been sampled this year.Scientists who study compounds like PFOS and PFOA consider the public health threat they pose to be significant because they are each toxic, water soluble, bio-accumulative and persist in the environment due to the strength of the fluorine-bonded, long-chain chemistry, which does not naturally degrade.According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, studies have shown long-chain PFAS like PFOS and PFOA have developmental toxicity, which makes exposure to children of particular concern. Exposure to PFOS has been linked to linked to delayed puberty onset and associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.This week, the DEQ announced Plainfield Township will receive a $19,500 state match wellhead protection grant to investigate locations for a new well field. Plainfield Township Superintendent Cameron Van Wyngarden expressed confidence in the township water quality, but also said tannery waste was ”certainly was in our minds as a potential source given the recent discoveries at other locations in our area.\”In Belmont, Wolverine is handing out bottled water and kitchen sink filters to homeowners with unsafe levels of PFAS in their private drinking water wells.Wolverine is also testing the Rogue River and the demolished tannery site in downtown Rockford for PFAS compounds this fall after a group of local citizens and a Grand Valley State University professor alerted the Grand Rapids DEQ office that the company made Hush Puppies with Scotchgard for decades in Rockford.\”Tefft said he feels bad about taking part in the waste dumping.\”At the time, nobody knew anything about chemicals or anything,\” said Tefft, a former firefighter in Rockford and Grand Rapids. \”Yea, we knew there were chemicals that did this, this and this. But what happened 50 years from now, we had no idea. I had a job to make a living for my family,\” he said. \”I never realized what I was doing was going to be bad.\”","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("HARBOR BEACH – Around 20 firefighters spent Monday containing roughly 100 gallons of diesel fuel after a boat owner left his tanks unattended at the marina.At around 8:30 a.m., the Harbor Beach Fire Department responded to the gas leak at the end of the dock in the marina.Jason Lermont, the fire chief, said a boat owner had been moving fuel from one tank to another when he went to grab a coffee. When the owner returned, he found diesel overflowing and spilling into the water.\“You want to contain it as quickly as possible, so you don’t have a fish kill or if someone is swimming nearby,\” Lermont said. \“We want to do whatever is best for the environment.\”To contain the spill, firefighters made a 300-foot radius around the boat using absorbent booms which sit on the surface. The booms surrounded the boat like ducks in a row and absorbed the spreading diesel. They were continually put into drums and then later disposed of by an environmental agency, Lermont said.\“The spill cleanup process went really well,\” Lermont said. \“The guys did a great job. The Coast Guard was there, they were happy. Michigan DEQ was there, they were happy.\”Assisting Harbor Beach: Caseville fire, which brought its boat to help set the radius; Sherman Township fire brought manpower; and Sigel Township fire brought extra booms.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("WASHINGTON — Rep. Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after reports that Imperial Oil Limited, a Canadian petroleum company, accidentally spilled water containing hydrochloric acid into the St. Clair River: \”Chemical Valley and the plants that line the St. Clair River pose a threat to the purity of water consumed by millions of residents across Southeast Michigan. Understanding this threat, in 2006, I helped secure federal funding to build and support a high-tech, realtime water quality monitoring system that stretched from Lake Huron to Lake Erie. After the installation of this system, the number of chemical spills dropped significantly. Unfortunately, maintaining this system was not made a priority and it eventually crumbled. Today, with the news of this most recent spill in the St. Clair River within such close proximity to multiple water intake facilities, we are reminded of threat posed by such spills and of the need to revive a monitoring system that provides residents with the assurances they deserve.\”","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("REED CITY — A combination of human and mechanical error caused thousands of gallons of wastewater to spill in Reed City this weekend.Around 9 p.m. Saturday night, a tank at the treatment plant overflowed and spilled more than 300,000 gallons of treated wastewater.The incident was caused by a malfunctioning valve on a large holding tank. Personnel at the plant said they were having issues with the valve and had been manually opening and closing it to maintain water levels. The valve was days away from being repaired.On Saturday evening, the tank filled up to the point where software regulating water levels registered a flood, which accelerated the treatment process and the malfunctioning valve didn’t open to release the excess water.As a result, the tank kept filling with water and began overflowing until workers discovered the malfunction around 7 a.m. Sunday morning.According to City Manager Ron Howell, about 10,000 gallons ran off the property into a nearby storm drain, and about 1,000 gallons made it to the Hersey River.The fluid in the tank had been treated and does not pose risk to humans or animals, Howell said after speaking with workers at the plant.\“At no point do we believe the Hersey River was polluted,\” Howell said.Howell said the city does not draw from the river for its water, but from wells throughout in the city. Because the water was at an advanced stage of treatment, no pollutants are believed to be involved in the spill, Howell said. However, the water did contain beneficial bacteria essential to breaking down waste. Howell said the bacteria does not pose a threat, but workers at the plant are spreading lye on the site as a precaution.The plant will also follow Department of Environmental Quality protocol to have the site tested for contamination, but Howell said he is confident that the assessment will not register pollutants.Workers would have been alerted that such a spill was taking place and could have responded much sooner, but the plant’s automatic dialer system was turned off because it was under maintenance and wasn't turned back on.The city council had brought up the issues of the current automatic dialer system at an earlier meeting and agreed to upgrade it, but the upgrade had not yet been completed. The dialer system was also expected to be completed this month.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("BUCHANAN — Buchanan High School was locked down for several hours Wednesday after a student spilled a small container full of liquid mercury he brought in from outside the school. Eighth-grader Jason Harkrider said the spill happened in teacher Lane Martin’s eighth-grade math class. Harkrider was sitting next to the student who brought in a \“medicine bottle\” containing mercury. Harkrider said the student was playing with the bottle when it spilled.\“He tried to hide it, but it was all over the place,\” Harkrider said. Richard Bell, Buchanan Community Schools business manager and acting superintendent, said the spill occurred around 11 a.m. Once Martin saw the spill, he opened a window, evacuated the room and locked it until authorities arrived to address the spill.Harvey Burnett, of the Buchanan Police Department, said elementary mercury has been banned in Michigan schools since the beginning of 2004 and that Buchanan High School was in compliance.\“Mercury spills that are not addressed properly can result in wide spread contamination,\” Burnett said. Because of the possibility of contamination, students were told to stay in their rooms before being released one at a time to their parents at the end of the school day. Students had to hand over their shoes to authorities before leaving the building. Burnett said the Michigan Health Department is scanning the shoes for contamination. Non-contaminated shoes should be returned Thursday, Bell said.It took until around 4:30 p.m. for the last students to leave. Teachers and administrators came afterwards.No students were contaminated, according to Steve Torres of the Berrien County Health Department.\“They wouldn’t have been allowed to leave if they had detected anything on them, so there should be no public health worries at all,\” Torres said. Bell said no disciplinary action has been taken against the student who brought in the mercury.\“It is still under investigation. We are still looking into it, gathering information,\” Bell said.Several students said the student that brought in the mercury had done so before. Harkrider said school officials had caught the student with mercury Tuesday.When asked if the student had brought mercury into the school before, Burnett said police and school officials are still investigating.Bell said he hopes school will be open Thursday, but won’t know until the building is tested for contamination.","CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("MARSHALL TOWNSHIP -- A leaking pipeline spilled about 840,000 gallons of oil into a creek leading to the Kalamazoo River on Monday, according to estimates from Enbridge Energy Partners, the company taking responsibility for the spill.The leak resulted from a pipeline malfunction that was still under investigation Monday, said Tom Fridel, general manager for Enbridge Liquids Pipelines in Chicago. The 30-inch pipeline carries about 8 million gallons of oil per day from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario, according to Enbridge.The leak originated at the Enbridge site, at 16000 Division Drive near the border of Marshall and Fredonia townships. The oil spilled into Talmadge Creek, which flows northwest into the Kalamazoo River. After the oil leak was detected, the pipeline pumps were shut down and the valves upstream and downstream from the leak were closed, according to a press release from Houston-based Enbridge and the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office of Emergency Management.Authorities are monitoring up to the Ceresco Dam and beyond, said Durk Dunham, the county's emergency management director. The timing of the spill is bad because recent storms have widened the river and caused it to carry the oil more quickly, said Calhoun County Sheriff Al Byam. The oil already has started to make its way west past the booms set up by workers in Marshall Township. The Emmett Township Department of Public Safety issued a warning on Monday evening telling people not to fish or swim in the river. The department said oil was leaking past barriers and toward Historic Bridge Park and said people should avoid the water.Two homes near the leak were evacuated because of safety concerns, but no more evacuations were anticipated, according to the press release. By late afternoon Monday, a thick layer of oil was visible at the juncture of the creek and the Kalamazoo River, near A Drive North and 15 1/2-Mile Road in Marshall Township.Many small fish had washed up on the banks of the river on Monday. River access points were staffed by the sheriff's department or Enbridge employees, and A Drive North near the spill was blocked off and policed by the Fredonia Township Fire Department on Monday afternoon. Battle Creek resident Jim Blankenship said he smelled oil and called 911 around 9 p.m. Sunday as he was leaving the Marshall Moonraker on 17-Mile Road. A call came into the dispatch center at 9:25 p.m., said Jeff Troyer, executive director of the Calhoun County Consolidated Dispatch Authority.The center dispatched the Marshall Fire Department, which then called Marshall Township around 11 p.m. because the spill occurred in the township, Troyer said. Currently, Marshall and Fredonia township fire departments; the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment; the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; the Calhoun County Sheriff's department; and Enbridge are involved in the cleanup, Dunham said.\”Our trained crews are out there dispatching boom and vacuum trucks, and we're going to recover that oil,\” Fridel said. It's too early to tell how long or how much money it will take to clean up the spill, Fridel said.\”We'll be here until it's done,\” he said.","CSVtest.csv")
