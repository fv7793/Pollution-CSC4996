newsTextToCSV("Drinking water in three Macomb and St. Clair county communities tested positive for contamination, according to state environmental officials. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality found perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, known as PFAS, in water in New Baltimore, Mount Clemens and Ira Township, MLive reported. The agency tested groundwater and treated drinking water in the area in January. The department issued letters March 2 alerting residents to the presence of the substances, which have been used in non-stick cookware, stain resistant fabrics and firefighting foams. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, thyroid disorders, elevated cholesterol and other diseases. Current contamination levels don't pose any significant danger, the department said. \"I want to assure the residents of the city that their water is safe to drink and that a boil water advisory has not been issued,\" New Baltimore Mayor John Dupray said. \”I will be attending a meeting with the MDEQ early next week to discuss this issue in greater detail. We strive to provide the highest quality water possible and will continue to do so.\” The contamination is believed to have originated in Lake St. Clair, though the exact source is unknown. Last year, Gov. Rick Snyder announced that the state is committed to spending more than $23 million to combat PFAS contamination. Plainfield Township, the Saginaw-Midland Corp., Huron Shores Regional Water Authority system in Tawas, Ann Arbor, Grayling and the village of Sparta have also detected PFAS in their water.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("CASCADE TOWNSHIP — Testing of private drinking wells near an airport southeast of Grand Rapids has found chemical contaminants after a report identified the airport's extensive use of toxic firefighting foam. WOOD-TV reports that Gordon Water Systems tested 20 wells at homes near the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Kent County. Many residents requested testing after the news station revealed the airport used the toxic firefighting foam for more than two decades. The company, which services Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids and Portage, found perfluorinated chemicals in four wells. The chemicals are often found in the firefighting foam. The tests didn't find any perfluorinated chemicals above the state's limit for drinking water. But many residents say the results show that widespread testing is needed. Airport officials say they're investigating the contaminants but have no immediate plans to test neighboring wells.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("Submerged cables that carried electricity between Michigan's two peninsulas were shut down after leaking about 550 gallons of coolant fluid into the waterway that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, officials said Tuesday. The fluid is a mineral-based synthetic oil used for insulation that can be harmful if released into the environment, said Jackie Olson, spokeswoman for American Transmission Co., which operates the cables. It was too early to know what ecological damage might have been done in the Straits of Mackinac, said Joe Haas, district supervisor for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. No warnings were issued for people to avoid the area, where shoreline areas remain blanketed with ice, said Lt. Rachel Wellman of the U.S. Coast Guard. \“We've confirmed the risk to human health is very low at the greatest,\” she said. Michigan's environmental agency advised nearby towns to monitor their drinking water. The leak was discovered after the two cables tripped offline Sunday evening, the company said in a statement. Pressure on the system was reduced Monday to keep the loss to a minimum as personnel traced the source of the leak. The cause was unknown and it wasn't immediately clear whether both cables were leaking, although both had sustained damage, Olson said. Crews were attempting to use hoses and a vacuum truck to pump out whatever fluid remained in the cables, Wellman said. The Coast Guard had two vessels standing by, with four mechanical skimmers and several thousand feet of boom, in case any of the material rose to the surface. Any of the liquid that isn't recovered or does not wash onto shoreline ice is likely to break up within a few days, Wellman said. The leaked coolant is known to be highly toxic to at least one type of aquatic insect in the Great Lakes but is considered less of a threat to fish, Haas said. \”That's encouraging, but it doesn't mean we aren't taking this very seriously,\” he said. \”This is obviously something we don't want in these public trust waters.\“ Pewaukee, Wis.-based American Transmission Co. owns and operates most of the electric transmission grid in Michigan's Upper Peninsula as well as parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois. One of the Straits of Mackinac cables was installed in 1975 and the other in the 1990s, Olson said. Wintry weather and the heavy shoreline ice hampered the company's investigation of the leak and influenced the decision Tuesday to shut down the cables.  No customers lost electric service because power was routed from other sources, she said. Although the cables were damaged beyond repair, the company is looking into restoring an electrical connection between Michigan's Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula. \“We will continue to investigate the cause of the incident, determine any necessary remediation efforts and continue communicating with the appropriate regulatory agencies,\“ COO Mark Davis said.", "CSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LAPEER (AP) — For more than 20 years, the Michigan town of Lapeer sent leftover sludge from its sewage treatment plant to area farms, supplying them with high-quality, free fertilizer while avoiding the expense of disposal elsewhere. But state inspectors ordered a halt to the practice in 2017 after learning the material was laced with one of the potentially harmful chemicals known collectively as PFAS, which are turning up in drinking water and some foods across the U.S. Now, the city of 8,800 expects to pay about $3 million to have the waste treated at another facility and the leftover solids shipped to a landfill. Testing has found elevated PFAS levels in just one field where the sludge was spread, but farmers have lost an economical fertilizer source and hope more contamination doesn't turn up. \”I feel bad for them,\“ said Michael Wurts, superintendent of the waste treatment plant, who ruefully recalls promoting sludge as an agricultural soil additive to growers in the community. \“The city didn't do anything malicious. We had no clue this was going on.\“ Lapeer isn't alone. For decades, sewage sludge from thousands of wastewater treatment plants has been used nationwide as cropland fertilizer. It's also applied to sports fields, golf courses and backyard gardens. About half of the 7 million tons generated annually in the U.S. is applied to farm fields and other lands, the Environmental Protection Agency says. While the sludge offers farmers a cheap source of fertilizer, there long have been concerns about contaminants in the material — and attention of late has turned to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The city of Marinette, Wisconsin, has stopped distributing sewage waste, also called \"biosolids,\" to farms after getting high PFAS readings. In Maine, a dairy farm was forced to shut down after sludge spread on the land was linked to high levels of PFAS in the milk. \“It's been devastating. We kind of get treated like we are criminals,\“ said Stoneridge Farm's Fred Stone, whose blood has also tested high for PFAS from what he believes was drinking contaminated water and milk over the years. The concern is that certain PFAS chemicals, which studies have associated with increased risk of cancer and damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid, could be absorbed by crops grown in soils treated with polluted sludge and wind up in foods. The Food and Drug Administration this year reported finding substantial levels of the chemicals in random samples of grocery store meats, dairy products, seafood and even off-the-shelf chocolate cake, although the study did not mention any connection to sewage waste. \“The FDA continues to work with other federal agencies to identify sources and reduce or eliminate pathways for dietary PFAS exposure including through use of biosolids,\“ spokeswoman Lindsay Haake said. The extent of any threat to the food supply is unknown because so little testing has been done, scientists say. \“We don't have a lot of data but the data we have suggests it's a problem,\“ Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said at a recent conference in Boston. \“We are finding that there are elevated levels of different PFAS in biosolids. We clearly need more research in this area.\“ Studies have documented PFAS absorption by some crops — lettuce, tomatoes and radishes among them — from soils fertilized with sewage byproducts. And the EPA's inspector general reported last year that the agency was falling short in tracking hundreds of pollutants in sludge, including PFAS. Yet despite growing evidence that at least some sludge is contaminated, the federal government hasn't limited PFAS in fertilizer or developed a standard for determining safe levels. That leaves fertilizer companies and farmers wondering what to do and fearful of consumer backlash. \“If you want to destroy agriculture in Michigan, start talking about, 'Hey, it could be contaminated with PFAS,\“ said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. \“People will see that and say, 'Oh, we can't trust them, we'll buy from elsewhere,' even though the problem is no worse in Michigan than it is anywhere else.\“ Studies going back almost two decades found PFAS in sludge, primarily from industrial wastewater that flows to municipal treatment facilities. Residential sewage is another source — from carpets, clothes and other household items containing PFAS. The grease- and water-resistant compounds, known as \“forever chemicals\“ because they don't degrade naturally and are believed capable of lingering indefinitely in the environment, also are found in firefighting foam used at military bases and airports. Evidence of a link between PFAS-laced sludge and food emerged in 2008, when the EPA found elevated levels of several compounds in sludge that a Decatur, Alabama utility had spread on 5,000 acres of farmland. They were detected in nearby waters and vegetation from the fields. The chemicals were traced to several companies that manufactured and used PFAS. \“I'm very concerned about replicating that in other states,\“ EPA's Andrew Lindstrom, whose lab ran tests there, said at the Boston conference. Milk from one dairy contained 270 parts per trillion of PFAS — almost four times the agency's nonbinding health risk level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, the two best- known chemicals in the class. An EPA \“action plan\“ in February acknowledged \“information gaps\“ about tainted sludge. It said the agency was developing better detection methods and assessing risks posed by PFOA and PFOS, which no longer are manufactured in the U.S. but remain widespread in the environment. \“We are studying the potential pathways by which PFAS are getting into biosolids and we are researching alternative methods for removing or destroying PFAS in biosolids if analysis indicates that detected levels are of risk and need reduction,\“ the agency told The Associated Press in a statement. Advocacy groups say EPA also should look at chemicals developed as replacements for PFOA and PFOS, which studies found accumulate in edible parts of plants. \“At least EPA should require that sludge be tested for PFAS before being applied to farm fields,\“ said Colin O'Neil, legislative director with the Environmental Working Group. Its inspector general reported last year that the EPA had identified 352 pollutants, including PFAS, in biosolids. But the report concluded the agency had too little data and other tools to assess their safety. Regulations require testing for only nine pollutants in sludge, all heavy metals. Several states are examining sewage sludge for PFAS contamination and assessing potential dangers. Maine has enacted a nonbinding advisory level for PFAS in sludge and New Hampshire is working with the U.S. Geological Survey on a soil study whose results will help them set a standard. Maine also found most biosolids from more than 30 wastewater treatment plants were above the state's advisory level while neighboring New Hampshire detected PFAS in tests of sludge from two dozen permit holders. Neither state found traceable levels of PFAS in the milk tested. Based on sludge tests at 41 plants, Michigan ordered several to stop distributing it to farms. After the state's environmental department ordered some plants to trace PFAS sent to them, several installed treatment systems that sharply reduced their pollution output, spokesman Scott Dean said. Among them was Lapeer Plating & Plastics, the automotive chrome manufacturer that caused the Lapeer contamination. But City Manager Dale Kerbyson said the company has reneged on a promise to help cover Lapeer's costs of dealing with the pollution and a lawsuit may be coming. \“I don't think the citizens of our city should have to pay for this,\“ Kerbyson said. Lapeer Plating & Plastics did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment. Although they complain about a lack of government standards, some cities and towns fear strict rules that could force costly infrastructure upgrades or sending sludge to out-of-state landfills. And companies worry they will be put out of business. \"This is the biggest issue that has hit the biosolids recycling profession in North America ever, because of regulatory overreaction,\" said Ned Beecher, executive director of the North East Biosolids and Residuals Association. Companies that manufacture compost — some from sewage sludge — contend tough standards are premature until scientists determine acceptable PFAS levels. \“We don't want people jumping to conclusions,\“ said Frank Franciosi, executive director of the U.S. Composting Council. If EPA cracks down on anyone, he said, it should be those who manufacture and use PFAS chemicals that enter the waste stream.", "CSVtest.csv")

Macomb County workers took action that day after receiving a tip about oil spilling into the Plumbrook Drain, near 19 Mile Road, west of Ryan Road. Crews from the Macomb County Public Works Office reportedly spent the day taking steps to \“contain and absorb\” the substance by setting up booms, or floating barriers. They reportedly searched the area to find where the suspected oil had come from. A photo produced by the county shows a rainbow-streaked sheen upon the drain’s water. In a statement, Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller encouraged people to be \“our eyes and ears\” to rapidly combat pollution. \“Protecting our waterways is our No. 1 priority. It is critical that we respond quickly so we are able to prevent pollutants from making their way into Lake St. Clair,\” she said. The news of the incident did not reach some Sterling Heights officials right away. At around 4 p.m. that afternoon, Sterling Heights Fire Chief Chris Martin said he was unaware of the spill and planned to look into the incident. The city’s community relations director, Bridget Kozlowski, also hadn’t heard about the incident until contacted by the Sentry. Dan Heaton, public relations manager for the Macomb County Public Works Office, said his department typically works with the Fire Department on environmental matters like these, though he added that he \“can’t speak directly to this incident.\” City officials said in a press release dated later that day that they told the Macomb County Public Works Office that a Sterling Heights Department of Public Works crew had used heavy machinery in the area, which might have affected the drain. \“The city of Sterling Heights is investigating whether the heavy machinery malfunctioned causing the discharge of hydraulic fluid and is fully cooperating with the MCPWO,\” the statement reads.","CSVtest.csv")
