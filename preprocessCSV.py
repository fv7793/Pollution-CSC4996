newsTextToCSV("WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration moved Thursday to revoke regulations on methane leaks from oil facilities, a proposal environmental advocates said would renounce key federal authority to regulate the climate-damaging gas.The proposed rule follows President Donald Trump’s directions to remove \“unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry,\” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement.Exxon Mobil and some other oil giants \”wary of blowback from growing public concern over global warming\” joined environmental groups in urging the Trump administration to drop the rollback on methane controls, although several state-level and national industry groups welcomed the easing.The step would be the latest in a series unwinding the Obama administration’s efforts to cut climate-changing emissions from the oil, gas and coal industries, including a 2016 rule regulating oil-industry methane leaks as a pollutant under the federal Clean Air Act.Trump has pushed to open vast expanses of U.S. wilderness and coastline to oil and gas drilling, speed construction of petroleum pipelines and ease regulations on the industry, dismissing calls from scientists in and out of government for rapid cuts in oil, gas and coal emissions to stave off the worst of climate change.Asked about global warming this week, Trump only lauded the United States’ \“tremendous wealth.\” \″The wealth is under its feet,\” he said, praising oil and gas production.Methane, the main component of natural gas, frequently leaks or is intentionally released during drilling operations. It traps far more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, doing 25 times the damage over the long term despite surviving for less time, according to the EPA.The oil and gas industry is the nation’s primary source of methane emissions, according to the EPA, accounting for nearly one-third in 2016.Under Trump, both the Interior Department and the EPA have proposed a series of rules \”some blocked by courts\” to loosen regulation of methane emissions.President Barack Obama’s administration had cited legal authority under the Clean Air Act to require companies to detect and stop methane leaks at oil and gas sites. The Trump administration contends that Obama’s EPA skipped required legal steps in making that decision, and its proposal Thursday seeks public comment on the issue.\“Essentially, this is the umpteenth iteration of the EPA’s exercise to define away its Clean Air Act authority ... to address air pollution and greenhouse gases,\” said Joseph Goffman, an EPA air official under Obama.Methane levels globally have risen to historic highs, and the oil industry’s U.S. shale gas boom has been the single largest driver of that, said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology at Cornell University.\“The increase in methane has contributed significantly to the accelerated global warming and climate disruption the Earth has experienced in recent years,\” Howarth said in an email.While environmental groups pointed to the long-term regulatory impact on methane overall, the oil industry said the direct immediate effect for methane emissions would be negligible.Controls on other, regulated pollutants would also capture methane before it leaks from pipelines, said Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute.The Obama-era requirements to find and fix methane leaks imposed \“a disproportionate effect on small businesses\” in the oil industry, Milito said. \“A lot of mom and pops would have their wells shut in, elderly people with wells on their properties that could be shut down\” under the rules to be rescinded.But the rollbacks on emissions from oilfields, storage sites and pipelines have split the oil industry, worrying some in the industry about growing blowback in a world increasingly mindful of climate change.Some oil majors this year urged the administration to crack down \”not ease up\” on the emissions. They repeated that request ThursdaRoyal Dutch Shell has long supported the direct regulation of methane and urged the administration earlier this year to write a rule regulating existing sources of methane emissions.\“While the law may change in this instance, our environmental commitments will stand,\” Gretchen Watkins, Shell U.S. president, said in a statement.Directly regulating methane emissions and driving down leaks is \“not only the right thing to do for the environment, there is also a clear business case for doing this,\” said Susan Dio, president of BP America, in a statement.Exxon Mobil spokesman Scott Silvestri said the oil giant would continue urging EPA \”as it has since last year\” to stick to directly regulating methane emissions from oil and gas facilities.Asked about those requests, Anne Idsal, the EPA’s acting assistant administrator for air, told reporters, \“We don’t preclude anyone from going above and beyond if that’s something they want to do.\” Environmental advocates and Democratic lawmakers called the rollback reckless.Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, top Democrat on the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, said, \“The Trump administration has continued to pursue a course that would increase profit margins for the oil and gas industry, even if it means cutting commonsense public health and environmental protections.\”","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("LAPEER, Mich. (AP) - For more than 20 years, the eastern Michigan town of Lapeer sent leftover sludge from its sewage treatment plant to area farms, supplying them with high-quality, free fertilizer while avoiding the expense of disposal elsewhere.But state inspectors ordered a halt to the practice in 2017 after learning the material was laced with one of the potentially harmful chemicals known collectively as PFAS, which are turning up in drinking water and some foods across the U.S.Now, the city of 8,800 expects to pay about $3 million to have the waste treated at another facility and the leftover solids shipped to a landfill. Testing has found elevated PFAS levels in just one field where the sludge was spread, but farmers have lost an economical fertilizer source and hope more contamination doesn’t turn up. \“I feel bad for them,\” said Michael Wurts, superintendent of the waste treatment plant, who ruefully recalls promoting sludge as an agricultural soil additive to growers in the community. \“The city didn’t do anything malicious. We had no clue this was going on.\” Lapeer isn’t alone. For decades, sewage sludge from thousands of wastewater treatment plants has been used nationwide as cropland fertilizer. It’s also applied to sports fields, golf courses and backyard gardens.About half of the 7 million tons generated annually in the U.S. is applied to farm fields and other lands, the Environmental Protection Agency says. While the sludge offers farmers a cheap source of fertilizer, there long have been concerns about contaminants in the material and attention of late has turned to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.The city of Marinette, Wisconsin, has stopped distributing sewage waste, also called \“biosolids,\” to farms after getting high PFAS readings. In Maine, a dairy farm was forced to shut down after sludge spread on the land was linked to high levels of PFAS in the milk.\“It’s been devastating. We kind of get treated like we are criminals,\” said Stoneridge Farm’s Fred Stone, whose blood has also tested high for PFAS from what he believes was drinking contaminated water and milk over the years.The concern is that certain PFAS chemicals, which studies have associated with increased risk of cancer and damage to organs such as the liver and thyroid, could be absorbed by crops grown in soils treated with polluted sludge and wind up in foods. The Food and Drug Administration this year reported finding substantial levels of the chemicals in random samples of grocery store meats, dairy products, seafood and even off-the-shelf chocolate cake, although the study did not mention any connection to sewage waste.\“The FDA continues to work with other federal agencies to identify sources and reduce or eliminate pathways for dietary PFAS exposure including through use of biosolids,\” spokeswoman Lindsay Haake said.The extent of any threat to the food supply is unknown because so little testing has been done, scientists say.\“We don’t have a lot of data but the data we have suggests it’s a problem,\” Linda Birnbaum, director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said at a recent conference in Boston. \“We are finding that there are elevated levels of different PFAS in biosolids. We clearly need more research in this area.\”Studies have documented PFAS absorption by some crops \”lettuce, tomatoes and radishes among them\” from soils fertilized with sewage byproducts. And the EPA’s inspector general reported last year that the agency was falling short in tracking hundreds of pollutants in sludge, including PFAS.Yet despite growing evidence that at least some sludge is contaminated, the federal government hasn’t limited PFAS in fertilizer or developed a standard for determining safe levels. That leaves fertilizer companies and farmers wondering what to do and fearful of consumer backlash.\“If you want to destroy agriculture in Michigan, start talking about, ’Hey, it could be contaminated with PFAS,'\” said Laura Campbell, agricultural ecology manager for the Michigan Farm Bureau. \“People will see that and say, ‘Oh, we can’t trust them, we’ll buy from elsewhere,’ even though the problem is no worse in Michigan than it is anywhere else.\”Studies going back almost two decades found PFAS in sludge, primarily from industrial wastewater that flows to municipal treatment facilities. Residential sewage is another source from carpets, clothes and other household items containing PFAS. The grease- and water-resistant compounds, known as \“forever chemicals\” because they don’t degrade naturally and are believed capable of lingering indefinitely in the environment, also are found in firefighting foam used at military bases and airports.Evidence of a link between PFAS-laced sludge and food emerged in 2008, when the EPA found elevated levels of several compounds in sludge that a Decatur, Alabama utility had spread on 5,000 acres of farmland. They were detected in nearby waters and vegetation from the fields. The chemicals were traced to several companies that manufactured and used PFAS.\“I’m very concerned about replicating that in other states,\” EPA’s Andrew Lindstrom, whose lab ran tests there, said at the Boston conference. Milk from one dairy contained 270 parts per trillion of PFAS almost four times the agency’s nonbinding health risk level of 70 ppt for PFOA and PFOS, the two best-known chemicals in the class.An EPA \“action plan\” in February acknowledged \“information gaps\” about tainted sludge. It said the agency was developing better detection methods and assessing risks posed by PFOA and PFOS, which no longer are manufactured in the U.S. but remain widespread in the environment.\“We are studying the potential pathways by which PFAS are getting into biosolids and we are researching alternative methods for removing or destroying PFAS in biosolids if analysis indicates that detected levels are of risk and need reduction,\” the agency told The Associated Press in a statement.Advocacy groups say EPA also should look at chemicals developed as replacements for PFOA and PFOS, which studies found accumulate in edible parts of plants.\“At least EPA should require that sludge be tested for PFAS before being applied to farm fields,\” said Colin O’Neil, legislative director with the Environmental Working Group.Its inspector general reported last year that the EPA had identified 352 pollutants, including PFAS, in biosolids. But the report concluded the agency had too little data and other tools to assess their safety. Regulations require testing for only nine pollutants in sludge, all heavy metals.Several states are examining sewage sludge for PFAS contamination and assessing potential dangers. Maine has enacted a nonbinding advisory level for PFAS in sludge and New Hampshire is working with the U.S. Geological Survey on a soil study whose results will help them set a standard.Maine also found most biosolids from more than 30 wastewater treatment plants were above the state’s advisory level while neighboring New Hampshire detected PFAS in tests of sludge from two dozen permit holders. Neither state found traceable levels of PFAS in the milk tested.Based on sludge tests at 41 plants, Michigan ordered several to stop distributing it to farms.After the state’s environmental department ordered some plants to trace PFAS sent to them, several installed treatment systems that sharply reduced their pollution output, spokesman Scott Dean said.Among them was Lapeer Plating & Plastics, the automotive chrome manufacturer that caused the Lapeer contamination.ut City Manager Dale Kerbyson said the company has reneged on a promise to help cover Lapeer’s costs of dealing with the pollution and a lawsuit may be coming. \“I don’t think the citizens of our city should have to pay for this,\” Kerbyson said.Lapeer Plating & Plastics did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.Although they complain about a lack of government standards, some cities and towns fear strict rules that could force costly infrastructure upgrades or sending sludge to out-of-state landfills. And companies worry they will be put out of business.“\This is the biggest issue that has hit the biosolids recycling profession in North America ever, because of regulatory overreaction,\” said Ned Beecher, executive director of the North East Biosolids and Residuals Association.Companies that manufacture compost \” some from sewage sludge\ ” contend tough standards are premature until scientists determine acceptable PFAS levels.\“We don’t want people jumping to conclusions,\” said Frank Franciosi, executive director of the U.S. Composting Council. If EPA cracks down on anyone, he said, it should be those who manufacture and use PFAS chemicals that enter the waste stream.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The nation’s largest public utility on Thursday agreed to dig up and remove about 12 million cubic yards (9.2 million cubic meters) of coal ash from unlined pits at a Tennessee coal-burning power plant.Prompted by two environmental groups, the state sued the Tennessee Valley Authority in 2015 over pollution from coal ash dumps at the Gallatin Fossil Plant. According to court filings, pollutants leach from the ash into the groundwater and then enter the Cumberland River, a source of drinking water for Nashville.The cleanup is expected to cost about $640 million and be finished by the year 2040.The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the environmental groups announced a settlement with TVA on Thursday. The utility has agreed to excavate the majority of the coal ash stored at Gallatin and recycle it or remove it to a lined, permitted landfill. It will also develop a plan for dealing with pollution from about 2.3 million cubic yards (1.7 million cubic meters) of ash remaining on site.TVA, which provides power to more than 10 million people in parts of seven Southern states, has recently come under increased scrutiny for its handling of coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal for power.Speaking at the Gallatin plant on Thursday, TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash said the utility is committed to the safe handling and storage of coal ash at its plants in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama. But he said other old, unlined ash pits may be capped and left in place if the utility determines it is safe to do so.The Environmental Protection Agency began working to regulate coal ash after an impoundment failed at another TVA plant in Kingston, spilling 5.4 million cubic yards (4.1 million cubic meters) of ash into the Emory River and surrounding community. The EPA released regulations in 2015 that treat coal ash more like household garbage than a hazardous material.But since then, workers involved in cleaning up the spill have sued the contractor that TVA hired to manage the job, saying chronic exposure to the ash sickened and even killed some workers. The parties have been ordered by the judge to try to mediate a settlement.TVA has said it is dewatering its coal ash dumps to help prevent leaching, but the utility has resisted calls to remove all ash to lined landfills.The settlement over the Gallatin ash is subject to a 30-day public comment period and the approval of the judge overseeing the case.Gary Weatherford is president of the Tennessee Scenic Rivers Association, one of the groups that pushed the state to act at the Gallatin plant. He said in a statement that the settlement is an example of the difference that citizen advocates can make in protecting waterways.\“We intend to continue to hold TVA responsible as it pursues the appropriate actions needed to safely remove this pollution, and we hope that others will join us as citizen watchdogs,\” he said.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("HOUSTON (AP) An emergency dike has been repaired and a fire-damaged petrochemical tank stabilized during cleanup of leaking oil products that closed part of the Houston Ship Channel, the operator of the complex said Sunday.Authorities are still trying to determine what caused a March 17 fire at Intercontinental Terminals Company’s Deer Park facility, which left several petrochemical tanks damaged or destroyed.Some tanks leaked oil products and a containment area was breached Friday, leading to the mixture reaching the ship channel, said Brent Weber, an ITC spokesman. The channel \” one of the busiest commercial waterways in the country\ ” was closed to traffic that day.Weber said the berm was fixed by Sunday.At least 52 vessels are waiting for the waterway to reopen, and the U.S. Coast Guard hopes to reopen the entire Houston Ship Channel by Monday morning, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Kelly Parker said.The massive fire more than a week ago thrust plumes of black smoke into the air and burned on and off for days. Harris County and ITC officials initially said air quality was not affected by the blaze, but by Thursday the National Guard was called in and residents were warned to stay inside for their own safety because of high levels of benzene in the air.The chemical evaporates quickly and can cause drowsiness, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and headaches, with worse symptoms at higher levels of exposure.Weber said Sunday that the company had been concerned about the possibility of benzene fumes escaping one tank damaged in the fire that contained pyrolysis gasoline. Starting Saturday, officials were pumping the flammable gas out of the tank to reduce that risk. That container has been secured and air monitoring continues, Weber said.\“We are in a safe place as far as protecting our responders and protecting the community,\” Weber told a news conference Sunday morning. He didn’t elaborate.Company officials say no pyrolysis gas leaked from the tank into the water.A statement Sunday from Harris County Public Health said there continues to be a low health risk to the general public.Some tanks were significantly damaged while others have very little product left in them, Weber said. Crews will be going through each tank to remove any leftover product.Oil products could be seen along a 2-mile (3-kilometer) stretch of the waterway, according to Lt. Cmdr. Jarod Toczko, another Coast Guard spokesman. Most of the product reached a bayou but oil booms were helping to protect the area.\“The majority of the product is contained with booms,\” Toczko said.About 60,000 gallons of oil product had been recovered from the water by Sunday, he said.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said Friday that ITC has a history of environmental violations and filed a lawsuit against the company, vowing to hold it \“accountable for the damage it has done to our environment.\”","IshaCSVtest.csv")

newsTextToCSV("TRENTON, N.J. (AP) New Jersey is ordering five companies that manufacture chemicals used to stain-proof clothing and produce non-stick cookware to spend what could be hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up contamination from the substances.The state Department of Environmental Protection Mo ordered the manufacturers Monday to provide a detailed account of their use and discharge of so-called PFAS substances over the years.The firms \” Solvay, DuPont, Dow DuPont, Chemours and 3M \” also must pay to clean up any contamination they caused. If they refuse or drag their feet, they could be charged three times the amount of money the state spends to deal with the problem.The substances are sometimes called \“forever chemicals\” because they do not break down, and tend to accumulate in the air, water, soil and even fish. They can harm fetuses and newborns, and have been associated with kidney and testicular cancer, auto-immune illnesses and decreased response to vaccines, according to the state.They have been used for more than 60 years and have become staples of modern life for consumers who want to protect their clothing from stains or water, and prevent food from sticking to cookware. They have been used in brands such as Stainmaster, Scotchgard, Teflon, Gore-Tex, and Tyvek, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.\“In issuing this directive, we are putting these five companies on notice that many years of contaminating New Jersey’s precious drinking water and other natural resources will not go unchecked,\” said Catherine McCabe, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner. \“On behalf of all New Jerseyans, we will hold these companies accountable and insist that they step up to address the problem they have created.\”Chemours issued a statement saying it is in regular contact with the state regarding such substances and had already decided to reduce air and water emissions of such substances by at least 99 percent.Solvay said it has already begun remediation efforts at its West Deptford, New Jersey facility, where such compounds are present.The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.McCabe said the substances are discovered on a near-daily basis in New Jersey’s drinking water, groundwater, surface waters, sediments, soils, air, fish, plants and other natural resources. Similar contamination has occurred throughout the country.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a plan to address PFAS contamination nationally, but that plan could take years. The companies have 21 days to say whether they intend to comply with the directive, which the state says is authorized by New Jersey’s Spill Compensation and Control Act, Water Pollution Control Act, and Air Pollution Control Act.\“This is critical that DEP is going after these companies to make them clean up their mess they made,\” said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club. He said the state’s limits for these substances in drinking water will be the strongest in the nation.The department would decide whether any plan proposed by the companies is sufficient, McCabe said.She recommended consumers avoid products that use these substances but acknowledged it is often hard to know whether they are present in a particular item of clothing or kitchenware.\“It seems like we keep doing this to ourselves: inventing these fabulous new things - remember DDT? and putting them into commerce without looking enough at the risks,\” McCabe said.","IshaCSVtest.csv")

The testing could take at least a week to be completed, she said.Marion Township trustee Jon Block said at a township board meeting Tuesday EGLE staff has indicated the barrels were found empty and had been for \“quite some time,\” the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday.\“Any resident anywhere near that property would be on a private well,\” Block said. \“There was discussion that the county could probably help in making sure those wells get tested immediately, while we’re awaiting results on whether or not there is contamination.\”Sayers owns Electro-Plating Services Inc., a now-closed chrome-plating company in suburban Detroit blamed for a green, hexavalent chromium-laden goo seeping onto the I-696 freeway late last month.An inspection found high levels of multiple contaminants in soil and groundwater at the old industrial site located in Madison Heights, according to state regulators. Hexavalent chromium is associated with cancer, kidney and liver damage, among other health effects.Sayers pleaded guilty to illegal storage of hazardous waste last February and was sentenced to a year in federal prison.Cleanup efforts are continuing in Madison Heights, leaving an eastbound lane on I-696 closed. More than 11,000 gallons of contaminants have been removed so far, Greenberg said.\“It’s working — we’re getting it out,\” she said. \“Our next step is to determine where the contaminant has migrated to.

ATC will remove the oil from the lines via vacuum as well as conduct overflights to monitor the spill.The product is comprised of mineral oil, a thin and light substance. Samples of the product have been sent for laboratory analysis. Given the dilution of the product and mobility of fish, there is a low risk to fisheries and wildlife. The greatest threat is to waterfowl or shore birds that may come in contact with the product floating on the surface. Due to the inaccessibility of the shorelines from ice, there is a low-risk threat to the public since they are unable to come in contact with the oil. The dilution of the oil and distance from the bridge provide additional protection from the product.There are two water intakes in the general vicinity, but given the dilution of the oil and the distance of the intakes from the source of the discharge, there is no significant threat to drinking water at this time.Commercial vessel traffic has not been impacted.\“Our top priorities are to protect public health, the safety of both responders and communities in this region, and limit the environmental impacts as we contain and clean-up the spill as quickly and efficiently as possible,\” said Capt.

The agency has ordered Wolverine to dredge the Rogue River and excavate along the White Pine Trail in Rockford.Wolverine said it’s reviewing the EPA’s letter, and \“looks forward to continuing to work with the agency to develop next steps.\”The EPA also requested that Wolverine put up signs to notify the public of potential hazards near river entry points by the end of May.\“There may be exposure risks that can’t necessarily wait for an overall plan to address the entire site,\” said Jeff Kimble, an EPA official who’s supervising the contamination investigations at Wolverine’s former tannery and dump site.Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, were discovered at Wolverine’s former Rockford factory grounds and its nearby waste dump in Belmont, sparking federal regulators to oversee contamination testing last year.The investigation uncovered high levels of volatile contaminants, including chromium and mercury. Some of the toxic metals were found in groundwater and sediment near areas where people often launch canoes and kayaks along White Pine Trail.The cleanup work could close some parts of the trail this summer, Kimble said.The Belmont site where Wolverine dumped waste in the 1960s has a PFAS plume that’s moving through an area where thousands of people rely on groundwater for drinking.
