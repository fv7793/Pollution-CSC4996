One day in Corktown, green ooze started to flow from a site and down the road. On 4/4/09, officials decided to clean up the mess. The report from April 24 2005 said the cleanup would be difficult. Following this, on 12/2007 and 24 March 2009, multiple cleanups were done. There was also a spill on 3-3-04 that has not yet been cleaned up. In addition, on Mar 22, there was another spill.
