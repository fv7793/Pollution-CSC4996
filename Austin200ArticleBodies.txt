 Former superintendent of Kenilworth Public Schools Thomas W. Tramaglini pleads guilty to relieving himself at the Holmdel High School athletic field. TRENTON - A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit brought by a former North Jersey schools superintendent who claimed Holmdel police violated his rights by leaking his mug shot to media outlets after he was cited for defecating on the Holmdel High School athletic field.

But U.S. District Court Judge Anne E. Thompson, in an opinion dated Sept. 9, said Tramaglini failed to show a connection between the alleged distribution of his mug shot and the termination of his employment. “The sensational media coverage he received seems to have stemmed from the evocative nature of plaintiff’s public defecation charge — “It is not clear how the mug shot — a simple neck-up photograph — plausibly could have caused any inaccurate reporting, and plaintiff does not allege that defendants publicly distributed any inaccurate information," the judge wrote. “Simply put, it can hardly be argued that but for the distribution of the mug shot — the only constitutionally deficient behavior alleged — the sensational media coverage and plaintiff’s termination would have transpired." The judge rejected Tramaglini’s claim that the dissemination of his mug shot violated his federal rights to privacy and due process. Other claims made in the lawsuit, including negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation and negligent hiring, training and supervision, belong in state court, not federal court, Thompson said in the opinion. Thompson could have exercised jurisdiction over the state claims, but she declined, leaving the door open for Tramaglini to file suit in state court. "A new complaint is forthcoming in state court,'' Matthew S. Adams, an attorney representing Tramaglini, said in an email. " Holmdel Township will be held accountable for its clear violations of established law.'' Attempts to reach township officials for comment were not immediately successful. The federal lawsuit, filed by Adams and Marissa Koblitz Kingman of the Morristown law firm Fox Rothschild, named Holmdel Township and Patrolman Jonathan C.  Martin and Police Chief John Mioduszewski of the township’s police force as defendants. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">ICYMI: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2019/02/26/thomas-tramaglini-matthew-adams-letter-gurbir-grewal/2990181002/" target="_blank">Kenilworth ex-superintendent dubbed 'super pooper': NJ must investigate Holmdel cops</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Holmdel superintendent: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/red-bank-middletown-area/holmdel/2018/05/04/holmdel-superintendent-wrongly-accused-media-rumors-pooping-field/582348002/" target="_blank">Don't mix me up with the HS field pooper</a></span> The attorneys first filed a tort claim notice with Holmdel Township stating they were seeking $1 million in damages for Tramaglini.

Tramaglini was charged with public defecation littering and lewdness. Thomas Tramaglini (right), the Kenilworth Schools superintendent accused of pooping on the track at Holmdel High School, makes his initial appearance in Holmdel Municipal Court Tuesday, June 12, 2018. He is shown with his attorney Matthew S. Adams. In rejecting Tramaglini’s argument that distributing his mug shot to the media violated his federal privacy rights, Thompson said, “First, the disclosure of a mug shot itself does not reveal any information that was not already public. “A mug shot merely provides a visual of someone with pending charges, and plaintiff does not allege that his pending charges were nonpublic," the judge wrote. “Second, a mug shot is not based in text. Its disclosure, without anything more, is less likely to facilitate false or inaccurate reporting about the defendant or his pending charges. Third, a mug shot is not the type of ‘highly personal matter representing the most intimate aspects of human affairs’ that historically has been protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.” Tramaglini’s attorneys also claimed in court filings that their client now faces the loss of his occupational license, but there has been no allegation that he has actually lost the license, the judge noted. “Such hypothetical harms cannot be addressed by this court," Thompson said. “More importantly, the Third Circuit has held that even a tenured professorship at a state university — quite a far cry from a non-tenured superintendent — is not afforded a constitutional protection under substantive due process." Thompson granted Tramaglini 14 days from her Sept. 9 order dismissing the suit to file an amended complaint correcting deficiencies in his original complaint. No such amended complaint has been filed, according to the electronic public access service of the federal courts system. <em>Kathleen Hopkins, a reporter in New Jersey since 1985, covers crime, court cases, legal issues, unsolved mysteries and just about every major murder trial to hit Monmouth and Ocean counties.

 Monmouth County has faced complaints from landfill neighbors about an oppressive stink. Here's a look at projects its pursuing to fix the issues. TINTON FALLS - One year after officials pledged to fix pungent odors seeping from the county landfill, several issues remain unresolved. Monmouth County spent $7.9 million on remedies to the 900-acre Monmouth County Reclamation Center, such as building 50 gas collection wells, which has resulted in fewer odor complaints to the state Department of Environmental Protection. Still, residents asked for more safeguards at a town hall meeting with local, county and state officials called by state Sen. Vin Gopal, D-Monmouth, on Thursday. On their list was the results of water tests on the Jumping Brook, a tributary of the Shark River, where leachate from the landfill leaked as a result of a side slope failure of the Phase III portion of the landfill, which was the principle cause of the odors to begin with. <strong><span class="exclude-from-newsgate"> [ The trusted place to find the best home service providers. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://homeservices.app.com/?gps-source=ADCONBLHSMA&amp;utm_source =cbm&amp;utm_medium= onsite&amp;utm_campaign=homeservices&amp;utm_term=trust&amp;utm_content=embed" target="_blank">Find local pros.</a> ]</span></strong> Compacted garbage is trucked to the landfill site at the Monmouth County Reclamation Center in Tinton Falls.

But the revelation is another indication of failed stewardship of the Shark River, where the water quality has forced regulators to place restrictions on how people can safely use the river. Cleanup crews respond to a fuel spill in the Shark River in 2016. Belmar's business administrator, Ed Kirschenbaum, said the borough has been meeting with state and county officials and "we're taking active steps to fix this problem" but he declined to elaborate.

"The DEP met with Belmar last week and Belmar has proposed closing the L Street Shark River beach to bathers until repairs to the system can be identified and corrected to prevent future discharges." "Aging infrastructure issues are not unique to Belmar," she continued. " By correcting these violations, however, Belmar should be able to prevent future sanitary sewer discharges to the Shark River." <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/courts/2019/04/10/neptune-baby-killed-courtroom-tears-teens-face-judge/3399772002/"><span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">NEPTUNE BABY KILLED: </strong >Courtroom in tears as teens accused in death of newborn face judge</span></a > The borough told the DEP that it was preparing a plan to more fully explore and document the deficiencies in their sewer system, according to a letter responding to the list of violations. Fixing aging infrastructure is never cheap, not when it's a road or a bridge, and not when it's a sewer that needs to be dug up and repaired or replaced. Kirschenbaum said the borough has not developed any cost estimate for the work that the DEP is demanding. That price tag would be separate from any punitive measures the state places on Belmar for the illegal discharges that have already taken place.

Monday's water samples found 190 colonies of enterococcus bacteria per 100 milliliters, a microbe found in feces that often signals the presence of other illness-causing pathogens. New Jersey law requires that beaches be closed if two consecutive days of water sampling at a bathing beach test above the state's threshold of 104 enterococci bacteria colonies per 100 milliliters. The bay front beach remained open on Tuesday, but could be closed to swimming and wading on Wednesday if second-day water samples also return bacteria counts over the threshold.

 The EPA is being urged to regulate a group of chemicals that are contaminating the public water supply in dozens of states. The group of chemicals known as PFAS were used in everything from nonstick cookware to firefighting foam. (Aug. 13) <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em><strong > Above:</strong > EPA urged to take action on PFAS.</em></span> A New Jersey congressman and environmentalists are urging the federal government to take action to protect millions of New Jersey residents from a group of chemicals found in more than 500 drinking water supplies across the state. U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat whose Sixth District stretches along coastal portions of Monmouth and Middlesex counties, is The chemicals are used in various types of manufacturing, such as non-stick cookware, grease-resistant food packaging, cleaning products, fire-fighting foams, and stain- and water-repellent fabrics. "This legislation is critical to stopping the flow of these harmful chemicals into our environment, drinking water, cooking products and more," Pallone said in a news release. "I look forward to the full House voting on this bill soon.” The Environmental Working Group, an organization dedicated to protecting human health, applauded Pallone's help in the call for stronger federal regulations. The group found A PFAS-containing sample water is taken during work at Michigan State University's Fraunhofer Center for Coatings and Diamond Technologies on Sept. 13, 2018. "It’s time for Congress to finally address the growing PFAS contamination crisis,” said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group PFAS accumulate in the environment and body and are believed to cause cancer, impede the immune system and affect infant birth weights, and disrupt thyroid function, among other harms, according to the The federal agency sets no limits on PFAS in drinking water, but has announced non-binding "health advisories" for the chemicals. The agency also established an action plan in February to address the growing contamination concern across the nation. In 2018, New Jersey established its own limits on PFAS at 13 parts per trillion. In contrast, the EPA's recommended drinking water limits are five times higher, at 70 parts per trillion. "PFAS are persistent, toxic chemicals that last forever and spread through our water, air and soil," Pallone said in a news release.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em><strong > Above:</strong> A look at PFAS contamination in Michigan.</em></span> In New Jersey, the Environmental Working Group found some of the highest levels of PFAS contamination at the former Naval Air Warfare Center in Trenton.

In March, the DEP "As the most densely populated state in the country and one of the most industrialized, New Jersey has had a particularly high occurrence of PFAS contamination in drinking water," McCabe said in July.

Over 100 days, the bacteria were able to break down 60 percent of the PFAS in the lab vials, according to Princeton University officials. “We would like to get the removal higher, and then go and test it in the field," Jaffe said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Environment: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/11/26/lakewood-nj-planning-board-eagle-ridge-gdms-holdings/4301350002/ " target="_blank">Lakewood board approves Eagle Ridge development plan amid legal controversy</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Climate change: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/land-environment/2019/11/26/rising-seas -put-more-jersey-shore-homes -risk-flooding/2521582001/" target="_blank">Flooding gets worse for Jersey Shore homes, even with no storms</a></span> <em >Amanda Oglesby is an Ocean County native who covers Brick, Barnegat and Lacey townships as well as the environment.

A field of romaine grows near Salinas in this file photo. The CDC advises consumers to look for a label showing where the romaine lettuce was grown, which could be on a sticker or printed on a package. Any lettuce labeled that way should be discarded.

Bill Marler, a nationally recognized food-safety lawyer in Seattle, issued a statement about the latest outbreak saying those who have fallen ill range from 3 to 89 years old. While no deaths have been reported, 39 people have been hospitalized and six developed a type of kidney failure, he said. “With more illnesses, now with at least six with acute kidney failure, it is past time for the leafy green industry to put the health, safety and lives of consumers first,” said Marler, in a prepared statement. “Since the early 2000s the industry has pushed prepackaged leafy greens on consumers without adequately addressing the root causes of many of these outbreaks – environmental contamination from cattle.'' The CDC has not, in its advisory, specified how the latest contamination occurred.

 You've heard the warnings, but here's why this strain of E. coli is particularly hard to avoid. An outbreak of E. coli cases linked to romaine lettuce grown in Salinas, California, now has spread to 23 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week. As of Sunday, there were 102 confirmed cases of people becoming ill after eating the lettuce, up from 67 the previous week, the CDC said in an update posted Wednesday on its website. In addition, at least one case has been confirmed in 23 states, including Arizona, where three cases Cases have occurred in the Western U.S., as well as the upper Midwest and East Coast states. Wisconsin and Ohio have seen the greatest number of cases. No deaths have yet been linked to the infections, but 58 people did require hospitalization, the CDC said. According to the CDC website, the first case traced to the outbreak occurred Sept. 24, but the bulk have occurred this past month. The agency issued an initial advisory Nov. 22. The CDC, on its website, says the advisory "includes all types of romaine lettuce harvested or grown in Salinas, such as whole heads of romaine; organic romaine; hearts of romaine; packages of pre-cut lettuce and salad mixes which contain romaine, including baby romaine, spring mix, and Caesar salad; and wraps or sandwiches that contain romaine."

In spring 2018, an outbreak involving romaine lettuce linked to Yuma farm fields prompted a similar advisory from the CDC. The outbreak was traced to contaminated canal water in the fields. At the time, Bill Marler, a nationally recognized food-safety lawyer in Seattle, said such outbreaks typically are traced back to cattle or feed lots. Again last November, another such advisory was issued for romaine lettuce grown in California. <strong>For more stories that matter: <a href="https://fullaccess.azcentral.com/newstart/specialoffer?gps-source=CPDIGARTICLE&amp;utm_medium =onsite&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_campaign =DIGITALARTICLE&amp;utm_content= CPDIGARTICLE%22">Click here to subscribe to azcentral.com</a>.

 Developing story More than 300 homes in Coolidge were advised to evacuate Friday as crews battled a fire for several hours into the night that began at an industrial plant. The fire began about 2 p.m. at a Bright International Corp. facility south of Coolidge Avenue and north of Skousen Road. The plant manufactures hair dye and often uses chemicals such as chlorine and bleach, explained Sgt. Shanna Martinez of the Coolidge Police Department. The facility was operational at the time the fire started but its employees were evacuated from the building and no one reported injuries, Martinez said. Evacuations were recommended about 4:40 p.m. for residents of the Landmark Ranch subdivision, east of the facility and in the path of the smoke from the fire, said Martinez. Additional evacuations were recommended about 6:40 p.m. for homes between Taylor Avenue and Martin Road and Arizona Boulevard to 9th Street, Martinez added. The neighborhoods are made up of more than 300 homes. Martinez did not know how many people evacuated their homes by 8:30 p.m. Friday night. <strong>For more stories that matter: <a href="https://fullaccess.azcentral.com/newstart/specialoffer?gps-source=CPDIGARTICLE&amp;utm_medium =onsite&amp;utm_source=article&amp;utm_campaign =DIGITALARTICLE&amp;utm_content= CPDIGARTICLE%22">Click here to subscribe to azcentral.com</a>.

"We also suggest to anyone with animals to keep them inside." Martinez said that, since police and fire agencies first responded to the call Friday afternoon, there has been a "steady" and "heavy" chemical cloud in the area that poses a potential risk to people. Two firefighters were transported to the hospital Friday but their injuries were not severe, said Martinez. Martinez said she could not provide an estimated time for when the fire would be contained or when suggested evacuations would end. Fire crews continued efforts to contain the fire as of 9 p.m. Friday. The police department said about 5 p.m. that the Coolidge Adult Center is open as a place of refuge for fire evacuees. Kaylee Hampton, an account clerk for the City of Coolidge, said about 7:40 p.m. that no one was currently at the Adult Center and that a total of four people had shown up to the center since the fire began.

 Phoenix Fire Department Three employees were exposed to a hazardous chemical when a package exploded Saturday morning at a Maryvale post office, Phoenix fire officials said. Fire crews responded to the U.S. post office near 4400 N. Maryvale Parkway on reports of a chemical spill, according to an email from Phoenix fire Capt. Danny Gile. The spill turned out to involve a shattered glass bottle of acetone, the Associated Press reported. Gile later told the AP "there was no malicious intent suspected" in connection with the package. "Workers at the post office reported a package that had exploded spilling an unknown chemical and exposing three employees," Gile said in the email.

 Freeway closed A crash involving five vehicles and one commercial truck pulling a semitrailer injured eight children and adults and closed part of the Loop 202-South Mountain Freeway in Phoenix on Tuesday afternoon and evening, officials said. The crash occurred Tuesday afternoon in the area of Loop 202 and Buckeye Road, according to Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Capt. Rob McDade. The Arizona Department of Transportation reported the crash on its website at 4:09 p.m. McDade said that of the eight people treated for injuries related to the crash, four were taken to the hospital, McDade said. A 44-year-old woman, a 29-year-old person, and a 2-year-old boy were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, and a 21-year-old woman was transported with minor injuries, McDade said. The other four patients were treated at the scene. The crash occurred when the driver of the commercial truck "braked and steered evasively to the left" to avoid colliding with congested traffic in the area, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Raul Garcia. The truck didn't stop in time and struck five vehicles, Garcia said. The driver sustained a minor injury and remained at the scene, Garcia said. Impairment is not believed to be a factor, Garcia said. According to Garcia, one commercial truck with an empty trailer was involved in the crash. One of the truck's "saddle tanks" ruptured in the crash, leaking about 20 to 30 gallons of diesel fuel on the roadway, Garcia said. However, McDade said just before 5 p.m. that two semitrucks were involved and that there were hazardous materials. One leaked about 20 gallons of diesel fuel on the roadway and another one was transporting oxygen and acetylene tanks, according to McDade. The tanks were secured and not leaking but damaged, McDade said. The northbound lanes of the freeway reopened as of 8:36 p.m., more than four hours after the crash, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation.

 Water flows into the Richard Miller Treatment Plant off Kellogg Avenue from retention ponds from the California Golf Course into the treatment facility in Cincinnati, on Friday, March 29, 2019. The treatment plant is responsible for the majority of the City of Cincinnati's water. For decades, Ohio River pollution control standards have been uniform among the states where it flows, to the benefit of many. From the humans who tap it for water, fish and play to the aquatic life dwelling in its depths, these standards are important to maintaining a healthy river, say a Cincinnati drinking water expert and environmentalists. But some of those standards would become voluntary under a new proposal put forth by the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission. The Commission, commonly referred to as ORSANCO, was established in 1948. Its goal – to create uniform standards aimed at preventing one state from polluting and harming stakeholders of another downriver – has sustained to this day. Last year, ORSANCO postponed a vote to eliminate entirely its standards. That plan was ultimately swapped for the current one: to allow states to voluntarily opt in to the standards recommended by ORSANCO. < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://offers.cincinnati.com/specialoffer?gps-source= CPNEWS&amp;utm_medium =onsite&amp;utm_source=news&amp;utm_campaign= NEWSROOM&amp;utm_content= maxlondberg"><span class="exclude-from-newsgate">SUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Subscribe now for access to all our coverage</span></a> The Though states must adhere to federal regulations, Whitteberry said, individual states can modify those standards, "and our concern is that some states will take more liberty with that and allow more liberal discharges" into the river if ORSANCO's proposal passes. The ORSANCO change could make the river vulnerable to "short-term political whims, either within states or at the federal level," Whitteberry added, though the immediate effect is unclear. A water clarifier at the Richard Miller Treatment Plant off Kellogg Avenue in Cincinnati, on Friday, March 29, 2019. The treatment plant is responsible for the majority of the City of Cincinnati's water. Greater Cincinnati Water Works provides drinking water from the Ohio River to most of Hamilton County and parts of Boone, Warren and Clermont counties. A public review of ORSANCO's proposal ends April 15, and a The next time you're in any sort of boat on the Ohio River bring along a waterproof case and jump on a mobile website that shows what's around you on the river. The Ohio River is a source for drinking water for more than 5 million people, according to ORSANCO. It runs 981 miles through or along six states: Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois, before flowing into the Mississippi River. Those six states plus New York and Virginia comprise the ORSANCO-member states. Three representatives from each state and two federally appointed commissioners comprise the Commission. Julie Weatherington-Rice works as a senior scientist for Bennett and Williams Environmental Consultants, a Westerville-based company that advises public water supplies in the U.S. and abroad. Weatherington-Rice called ORSANCO an historical "king of responsibility" and "guiding light of how you did it right." "So this is such a huge change," she said. "They were the folks everyone counted on ... so having this decision of not maintaining this really strong, responsible role is disheartening because you’ve got uneven application of pollution controls among the states." Ronald Potesta, the chairman of ORSANCO from West Virginia, attended ORSANCO's first public hearing last week in Pittsburgh, according to the He pointed to the federal Clean Water Act as providing protection for the river. “Now the issue is, if we have the Clean Water Act and the states have their own standards, how much is ORSANCO needed?” Potesta said. Jheri Neri, a project director with the Greater Cincinnati Native American Coalition, expressed concern that the proposal could have adverse effects on livestock, irrigation and aquifers. Marie Kocoshis, co-president of the League of Women Voters, said economic development along the river could be hindered by softer regulation. Cheryl Johncox, a Sierra Club organizer, listed the coal and fracked gas industries as the biggest potential beneficiaries of ORSANCO's proposal. Duke Energy does not oppose the ORSANCO proposal as it stands. "We will work with the state on implementation of the proposal once it is adopted," said Sally Thelen, a spokeswoman for the power company. Bruce Whitteberry, the Greater Cincinnati Water Works official, is also the chairman of the Water Users Advisory Committee within ORSANCO. He said commissioners discussed for years how to respond to a ruling in Ohio that dismissed an ORSANCO standard meant to protect human health. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency issued a permit barring Dayton Power & Light's J.M Stuart Station from dumping water that exceeded 110 degrees into the river. The station is a coal-fired power plant located along the river in Aberdeen, Ohio, according to documents filed with the Environmental Review Appeals Commission. ERAC handled the 2014 case after Dayton Power & Light and other energy companies, including Duke Energy, challenged the permit requirement. The Ohio EPA argued state statute gave it the authority to implement the temperature cap, which mirrored the language of an ORSANCO standard. Duke Energy officials said the power company did not oppose the water maximum standard itself. Duke Energy, as part of the Ohio Utility Group as a whole, opposed the EPA not following the proper procedure when the Ohio EPA imposed the temperature limit, according to Thelen. She said the Ohio Utility Group (OUG) litigated based on more of a legal argument or procedural argument as opposed to a direct opposition to the temperature limit itself. She said the Ohio EPA is required, according to a Supreme Court ruling, to promulgate the temperature limit in a rule before they impose that limit in the permit to discharge water into the river. She added the Ohio EPA skipped the step of making the water discharge temperature limit part of their rules and went directly to the step of placing that limit in a permit. ERAC ruled in the energy companies' favor. The commissioners who made the ruling relied in part on Merriam Webster's Online Dictionary to argue heated water didn't qualify as a "substance" as used in Ohio code. "It would be illogical to conclude that the condition of the water itself – as opposed to a material added to water – constitutes a 'substance' regulated under Ohio's water pollution control laws," the commissioners wrote.

Bruce Whitteberry, a Greater Cincinnati Water Works official, stands at the Richard Miller Treatment Plant off Kellogg Avenue in Cincinnati, on Friday, March 29, 2019. The treatment plant is responsible for the majority of the City of Cincinnati's water. Whitteberry said the crux of the issue was protecting human health, to ensure people "wouldn't get burned if they swam in the river" near a power station's discharge pipe. The ruling "opened a can of words, so to speak, because the commissioners from various states said, 'Well, we’re kind of caught between a rock and a hard place,'" Whitteberry said. "Because if a state is prohibiting it and ORSANCO is requiring it, where does that put us?" The Commission is accepting public comments and technical and scientific studies and data supporting those comments through April 15.

 Concerned resident Loa Bennett made signs opposing the pollution standards changes during the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission meeting. COVINGTON – Loa Bennett sat in the back row of a chilled hotel conference room and quickly drew a sign that read “H2O above Strife.” She held it high as the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) discussed if it would approve a change to make regional pollution control standards voluntary instead of mandatory. On Thursday, the Ohio commissioners Stuart Bruny, Laurie Stevenson and John Hoopingarner voted for the change. Kentucky commissioners C. Ronald Lovan, Charles G. Snavely and Jenean Hampton also voted to make the pollution control standards voluntary. The decision came after a handful of concerned citizens and activists urged the commission to nix the change, warning what it could do to the health of the Ohio River. The Cincinnati-based commission recommends water-quality standards to the eight states either in the Ohio River's path or in its watershed. “We strongly disagree with today’s vote. We think it’s really a punch in the gut to the 5 million people who depend on the Ohio River for their drinking water, for their jobs and their way of life,” said Jordan Lubetkin, director of regional communications for the National Wildlife Federation. In 2018 the commission faced a proposal that would have eliminated all regional pollution control standards. Members representing the eight states in the commission voted against that, which was an environmental win, Lubetkin explained. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2018/10/05/ohio-river-oversight-group-could-eliminate-water-quality-standards/1528279002/" target="_blank">Ohio River: Oversight group postpones decision on eliminating water-quality standards</a></span> “By making them voluntary, of course, that essentially says we don’t have standards,” he said. The commission did approve an amendment to the standards change. The commission will review its programs that involve implementation of the pollution control standards for scientific or policy modifications. The amendment included language that the commission would get a report with the results from that review. “You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig,” said Lubetkin when asked about the amendment. As the commission members discussed the proposal, Bennett sat still, silently holding her sign. Others approached the podium and advocated for mandatory protections. “When did clean drinking water become an option?” asked Maria Truitt, a member of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth. Local teacher Joshua Kruer told the commission the decision would most impact their kids “ORSANCO decided that the interests of polluters are more important than the health of give million Ohio River residents who rely on the river for drinking water,” said Cheryl Johncox, Sierra Club Organizer in a release. PennFuture, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in Pennsylvania weighed in as well. “This decision by ORSANCO is mind-boggling, especially when considering more than 4,000 people spoke out against the proposal during a public comment period, and only nine people supported it,” said Matthew Stepp, vice president and chief of staff for PennFuture in a release. “With the federal government already set on dismantling environmental laws and protections, now is not the time to weaken regional water quality standards along the Ohio River.” Commissioner Douglas Conroe from New York, who voted against the water quality oversight changes, urged the commission to not “fix a wheel that’s not broken.” “We are responsible for the world that we create,” said Bennett. <em >Julia is the new Northern Kentucky government reporter through the Report For America program.

Winton Terrace, one of Cincinnati's oldest public housing projects, is wedged against one of the densest industrial areas of the city. Six facilities within 1000 yards of Winton Terrace produce nearly 40 percent of all the toxic air emissions in the city. Both Driehaus and Landsman have said if the Ohio EPA doesn't take action because there are no substantial health risks, they will attempt to solve the problems of the odors themselves. Fatty, burning smells flood into the neighborhood periodically. Residents report that the odors drive them indoors and can even wake them up at night. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://offers.cincinnati.com/specialoffer?gps-source= CPNEWS&amp;utm_medium=onsite&amp;utm_source=news&amp;utm_campaign= NEWSROOM&amp;utm_content =JENNIEKEY" target="_blank">Subscribe now for unlimited access to coverage on Cincinnati.com</a></span> The elected officials said they were willing to meet with the companies in question to address the issue and have also explored using city and county nuisance ordinances.

 Budget cuts could force layoffs and slow the cleanup of the former Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Piketon, Ohio. A "minor miscalculation" resulted in the underreporting of contamination in Pike County near the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant, according to a federal official. The corrected dose rates remain "far below health and safety standards," the Department of Energy said. In a letter sent last week, Paul Dabbar, undersecretary of science for the DOE, wrote that the underreporting involved "individual dose rates provided in several reports. " The reports included the 2001 to 2017 annual National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants Reports and the Annual Site Environmental Reports, also from 2001 to 2017, Dabbar wrote. The error was discovered by a private contractor during a review requested by the DOE. Dabbar's letter was sent to to Pike County Health Commissioner Matt Brewster and the Scioto Valley School Board. The error did not affect data from 2015 through the first quarter of 2019, Dabbar wrote. Alicyn Gitlin, Uqualla, Carletta Tilousi and Ophelia Watahomigie-Corliss talk about Canyon Mine during Havasupai Tribe's Intertribal Spiritual Gathering at Red Butte.

She said the DOE did not notify the community about the neptunium detection for two years. "It seems DOE is accountable to no one," she said, "and the Piketon community has been let down by the Ohio delegation." Dabbar wrote that the DOE continues to support Pike County officials' desire for a study of contaminants in the area conducted by an independent party.

 Civil rights icon Marian Spencer recalls her landmark lawsuit which broke the color line at Cincinnati's Coney Island. <strong>Update, 8:35 a.m., July 11: </strong> <strong>Original story: </strong> Not only did she hear them, Marian Regelia Alexander Spencer carried out her grandfather's words. "Every morning, he preached that we should never fail to vote, we should get our education, and speak up when we saw wrong being done," she said. Spencer, who led the battle to desegregate Coney Island's swimming pools in the 1950s and became the first African American woman elected to Cincinnati City Council in 1983, died Tuesday. She was 99. Spencer, of Avondale, died at 9:55 p.m. Tuesday at Hospice of Cincinnati at Twin Towers in College Hill. She had suffered a stroke on her 99th birthday, June 28, said her niece, Camille Haamid, of Clifton. Spencer was hospitalized for three days at University of Cincinnati Medical Center and then returned to her room at Twin Towers. "I simply would say I am lucky to have had two mothers," said Haamid, who is the daughter of Marian's twin sister, Mildred, who is in hospice in Washington, D.C. "What happened to one – even a cold -- seemed to happen to the other. "Aunt Marian was one of the nicest people. She was gracious all the time. Some people act that way in public. Aunt Marian was gracious and kind when she was making breakfast." <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/07/10/marian-spencer-dorm-school-and-street-all-named-civil-rights-icon/1690788001/" target="_blank">What did Marian Spencer mean to Cincinnati? We named things for her - before she died</a></span> Opinion: Marian Spencer: A legacy of fighting justice By any measure, as an individual or in partnership with her late husband, Donald Spencer Sr., Marian Spencer lived a life of consequence and purpose. Friends and admirers referred to her as "Ms. Civil Rights." "She was Cincinnati's redeemer," said retired federal judge Nathaniel Jones, who met the Spencers in the early 1970s when they traveled to New York to meet with him. He was general counsel of the national NAACP at the time. The Spencers, leaders of the local NAACP branch, wanted Jones' help in desegregating Cincinnati Public Schools. The Spencers had raised $30,000 as a sign of good faith, Jones said. "Marian made it possible for people to realize they were better than they thought they were," Jones said. "To that extent, she assisted people in realizing their potential goodness." Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley is among Spencer's admirers. "Small in stature, but a giant in impact, Marian Spencer led by example to build a more integrated city, and we are all trying to live up to her example," Cranley said. "We mourn this loss but we are so grateful our city is better for her life." In March 2016, the city of Cincinnati named a portion of Walnut Street Downtown in her honor. Marian Spencer Way runs between Theodore Berry Way and Second Street at The Banks. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. "One of my greatest joys as mayor was driving her to City Hall the day we named a street in her honor, during which she shared with me that as a granddaughter of a slave she has seen a lot of change for the better," Cranley said. "She was that change." Cranley on Wednesday said he has asked that city flags be flown at half-staff in her honor. Though biracial, with a mix of African American, Cherokee and Scottish immigrant ancestors, she identified as African American. "If one drop of black blood is so precious, I was going to claim it," Spencer said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/07/10/twitter-reacts-to-marian-spencer-death/1692443001/" target="_blank">Twitter reacts to Marian Spencer's death</a></span> Marian Spencer is sworn in as Cincinnati's vice mayor on Dec. 1, 1983. In fact, in an interview with The Enquirer a few weeks before her 98th birthday in 2018, Spencer ranked the Coney Island campaign as her top achievement in a life filled with them. One day in 1952, her sons – Donald Jr., 10, and Edward 8 – were watching a popular local children's TV program, "The Uncle Al Show," and saw a commercial for the park: "Everyone comes to Coney Island." "When my kids said they wanted to go, I waited until they weren't around and called," Spencer said. "I talked to the girl who answered. I said, `We're Negroes, can we get in?' She was very quiet and said, `No, but I don't make the rules.' "I said, `I know you don't, sweetheart, but I am going to find out who does. ' I got 25 mothers and grandmothers together in Walnut Hills, and that's where I started the fight." She built the foundation of her coalition with women because black men were afraid of losing their jobs at that time. Other supporters came from the Woman's City Club of Greater Cincinnati, where Spencer was one of the first African American members. Spencer also was head of the NAACP's Legislative Committee then and found a young black lawyer, Michael Turpeau, to take the case. On the Fourth of July 1952, an armed guard chased Spencer and other women protestors away from the park gate. Marian Spencer led the protest and legal battle to integrate Coney Island's Sunlite Pool, which was achieved in 1961. She didn't give up even in the face of stubborn segregationists. The park was desegregated in 1955, but the whites-only rule for Coney's main attraction, Sunlite Pool, held on until 1961. "I never felt I had to accept anything I didn't want to," Spencer said. "I didn't accept a `no' when it was wrong. It has been my responsibility to change things." She was valedictorian of her graduating class at Gallia Academy High School. She moved to Cincinnati with her twin in 1938 to attend the University of Cincinnati. She married Donald Spencer on Aug. 12, 1940, and gave birth to Donald Jr. on Jan. 12, 1942. Later that spring, she earned her undergraduate degree in English from UC. She was prohibited as an African American from living on campus, but in December 2017 the university named its newest residence building after her, Marian Spencer Hall. She had served on the UC Board of Trustees from 1975 to 1980. "Marian Spencer was a persistent and mighty agent of change who dedicated her life to justice and breaking down barriers that restrict the lives and opportunities of Americans of color," UC President Neville Pinto said. "We have lost a true trailblazer. Her example will inspire generations to come." Spencer sat in the living room of the house that she and her husband, a teacher who also worked in real estate, had built at the end of Lexington Avenue in Avondale in the early 1950s. Her friend and biographer, Dorothy Christenson, who wrote "Keep on Fighting: The Life and Civil Rights Legacy of Marian A. Spencer," joined Spencer for the interview. The book was published in 2015 by Ohio University Press. "She never demanded a spotlight for herself," said Christenson, who moved with her late husband to Cincinnati in 1971 and met Spencer through the fair-housing group Housing Opportunities Made Equal (HOME), the nonprofit Spencer had helped to create in 1969. "Through it all, she knew she was dealing with big egos," Christenson added. " She said she would never get anywhere if she wasn't polite. She was polite. She smiled. She was tenacious. She is such a fine role model for anyone, particularly young African-American woman." Though she lost, Spencer considered her failed run for the Cincinnati Board of Education in 1973 another accomplishment. She supported busing and school integration and had been instrumental in the NAACP's legal efforts to desegregate Cincinnati Public Schools in 1972. She chaired the education committee of the Cincinnati NAACP branch for 20 years and was elected the chapter's first female president in 1981. "You don't win them all," she said in retrospect of her school board loss. "You learn from it and move on. That's what I always told my sons." Spencer lived by those words. As NAACP chapter president in the early 1980s, she teamed with famed civil rights preacher the Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth to clean up a polluted site in Lower Price Hill. Their work led to a city ordinance, which was later adapted into national Superfund legislation. Leaders of the Charter Committee asked her to run for city council as a Charterite. "They asked me, and I ran," Spencer said. Her election, she added, "meant a few people thought I was right." Hers was a life filled with public service and firsts. Including Cincinnati City Council. "I was in tears this morning when I heard the news," said councilwoman Tamaya Dennard, who is African American. "I think about what I am up against in 2019, but the fight I have is nothing compared to what she faced. "I wouldn't be there if not for her taking the darts and insults. She paved the way for me. I stand on her shoulders." Spencer served on boards or worked in other capacities with the U.S. Civil Rights Commission Ohio Advisory Board, Planned Parenthood, the Cincinnati Human Services Task Force, American Civil Liberties Union, Cincinnati Woman's City Club and the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. She represented the Ohio Democratic Party at the party's national conventions in 1984 and 1988. A list of her awards covers more than three pages in her biography. Her honors include Cincinnati Enquirer Woman of the Year in 1972, Great Living Cincinnatian in 1998, the Ohio Civil Rights Hall of Fame in 2010 and YWCA Racial Justice Award in 2011. In 2015, the Cincinnatus Association created the Donald and Marian Spencer "Spirit of America" Awards to recognize advocates of inclusion. Spencer is survived by her two sons, Donald Spencer Jr. of Avondale and Edward Spencer of Richmond, California; three grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. Her husband, Donald Spencer Sr., preceded her in death in 2010 at age 95. A private ceremony for family and close friends will precede cremation. Her ashes will go to Fox Lake, Indiana, where she summered and swam. A public memorial celebration of her life will be held at 3 p.m. on Aug. 10 in the Fifth Third Arena at the University of Cincinnati. Donald and Marian Spencer mourn the death in 2000 of their longtime friend and political ally Ted Berry.

 A screenshot of a photo in an Ohio EPA report shows Norwood's two water storage tanks in May. The tanks have been taken out of service after a dead bird was found in one tank and holes in the roof and corrosion was found in both tanks. Cincinnati and Ohio EPA officials found Norwood's initial response to concerns about public drinking water lacked "a sense of urgency," according to messages from officials released this week. Norwood has been working to keep its water system online after an OEPA report found the city didn't adequately The OEPA has consistently said the The messages were given to The Enquirer by Norwood councilman James Bonsall, who requested them from Greater Cincinnati Water Works (GCWW) because he said he couldn't get answers about the water system from his own city. Water Works officials later shared the same messages with The Enquirer. Once the OEPA realized the severity of the water system issues, it helped broker a deal with Greater Cincinnati Water Works to provide emergency assistance to Norwood. Since then, state and Cincinnati officials found Norwood's response lacking at times, according to the messages. On the morning of July 11, Mariano Haensel, an OEPA environmental specialist, sent Norwood Safety Service Director Joe Geers a blistering email for lack of action. Geers is the permit-holder for Norwood's water system. Haensel said he had asked Geers to put in writing by 3 p.m. on July 10 when the water tanks would be taken out of service for repair. Haensel said he called Geers after not hearing from him at the deadline and there was no answer. < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://checkout.cincinnati.com/cincinnati_DF" target="_blank"><span class="exclude-from-newsgate">Subscribe now for unlimited access to Cincinnati.com.</span></a> Geers said in a reply to Haensel that he informed the OEPA that the answer wouldn't come until July 11. "It is not acceptable to operate with finished drinking water storage tanks expose(d) to the atmosphere and to animal and vermin intrusion," Haensel said.

"Verna called Joe Geers at 3 (p.m.) and he was at a boat race," Bailey said. Geers declined to even listen to questions or comments made about him in this story. "I have nothing to say," Geers said. "I have no comment. You have all the information you need." On the same day, Bailey sent a text to Cincinnati City Manager Patrick Duhaney and Assistant City Manager Sheryl Long saying she was concerned Norwood didn't have the resources to do what GCWW needed from it. Bailey said Norwood Mayor Thomas Williams was smiling and hugged her when the agreement was hashed out. "(He) told me after we put the joint communications out 'then that's it , it's done,' " Bailey wrote in the text. "It was shocking to me as it felt that he really felt that was all we had to do. They just don't get it." "But Norwood water system, operator of record, just doesn't seem to have a sense of urgency in fixing their storage tank and system challenges," she wrote. City Manager Patrick Duhaney Williams, a former police officer who lived in Norwood most of his life, said he does understand the severity of the problems. "To say someone would knowingly put our people at risk, we wouldn't do that," Williams said. "My God. We all live here. I have family here and Joe and his family live here." Williams said Geers has been working on the issue every day, but Cincinnati's help is needed. "We don't have the expertise," he said. "We just don't. They have engineers and they've been very helpful." Williams "We don't know for sure to get those tanks evaluated if we can build a three-million gallon tank for $6 million," he said. "We don't have $600,000 much less $6 million." Bonsall, the Norwood councilman, said he plans to make a formal motion to ask Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and Duhaney if Bailey can come to answer questions at a Norwood council meeting. Bonsall said he wants clarity on what Cincinnati thinks should be done short-term and long-term. "The problems with our water system go beyond the water towers," Bonsall said. < a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/420571571/Ohio-EPA-sends-violation-to-Norwood-Safety-Service-Director-Joe-Geers#from_embed" style="text-decoration: underline ;" title="View Ohio EPA sends violation to Norwood Safety Service Director Joe Geers on Scribd">Ohio EPA sends violation to Norwood Safety Service Director Joe Geers</a>

 An aerial photo of the Rumpke Sanitary Landfill in Colerain Township taken in 2009. State Route 27 is seen at the top of the photo. The Ohio EPA has approved permits for Rumpke to expand its Hughes Road landfill in Colerain Township. Two air pollution permits and a wastewater discharge permit have also been approved. "The expansion permit allows the company to add approximately 240 acres to the east of the existing landfill, giving the facility about 30 years’ capacity," Ohio EPA officials said in a Monday press release. The air pollution permits cover emissions from the landfill and facility roadways as well as GSF Energy's gas recovery plants at the site. The wastewater permit allows Rumpke to made a sedimentation pond to collect, treat and discharge stormwater. The Ohio EPA held a public meeting about the project on April 2, and posted its response to many of the concerns online.

 Three dogs died hours after playing at a pond in North Carolina with blue-green algae. The owners want to bring awareness to others. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/nation/2019/08/13/blue-green-algae-kills-dogs-north-carolina-pond-owner-says/1995217001/" target="_blank">After toxic blue-green algae took the lives of three dogs</a> Ohio State Health officials are advising that guests adhere to all advisories and check the status of slow-moving water before visiting any parks in Ohio. Advisories for state park beaches in Ohio have two levels. An orange sign indicates that an algal bloom has been detected. If you see an orange advisory, swimming and wading is not recommended for children, pregnant or nursing women, or those with medical conditions and pets. A red sign indicates an elevated recreational public health advisory which means that algal toxins at unsafe levels have been detected and to avoid all contact with water. Two Ohio beaches are on an elevated advisory. Buckeye Lake in Fairfield County, which has tested positive for blue-green algae 11 times since May 14, is currently on alert and was last tested on July 30. Lake Erie at Maumee Bay State Park last tested positive for blue-green algae at an elevated advisory on Aug. 5. Blue-green algae bloom can cause an assortment of health problems in people. In addition to signs, officials recommend calling a local park to check the status of their water or visiting the "Not all blue-green algae produce toxins. You'll see blue-green algae that is perfectly fine. The important thing is to call your local parks, follow the signs, and know before you go," said Eric Heis, Ohio Department of Natural Resources Public Information Officer. Exposure to blue-green algae can happen by swallowing water from a contaminated lake or skin contact through recreational activities such as swimming and wading. Skin contact may cause rashes, hives, or skin blisters, especially on the lips and under swimsuits, according to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Officials said dogs are particularly susceptible to blue-green algae poisoning because the scum can attach to their coats and be swallowed during self-cleaning. Swallowing contaminated water can also cause severe diarrhea, vomiting, liver and kidney toxicity, numbness, difficulty breathing and death. Blue-green algae coated waters near the banks of Lake Washington Monday (7/29/2019), where signs warn of potentially toxic algae. According to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Blue-green algae are bacteria that are naturally found in Ohio lakes, ponds and slow-moving streams and are most often blueish-green to red in color. Blue-green algae can be visible as thick mats on the surface of water or can be present without visible surface scum. The algae tend to "bloom" in warmer months and are often caused by nutrient pollution and runoff of fertilizers, animal manure, sewage treatment plant dischargees, storm water runoff, car and power plant emissions and failing septic tanks, according to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. If pets come into contact with algae, rinse them off with clean, fresh water and soap immediately to remove the toxin, according to ODNR. Do not let them lick algae from their fur. If your pet shows any of the clinical signs of ingesti algal infected water, contact your veterinarian immediately.

Up to six vehicles may be involved in the collision, which was reported just after 6 a.m. Thursday, according to initial emergency reports. David Hill with Sawyer Truck Towing said it took a little while longer to reopen the highway due to a fuel leak. One of the vehicles involved in the crash leaked a significant amount of transmission fluid that is all across the northbound lanes, he said. Crews tried to put down something to dry the road, but it was not enough to cover the amount of transmission fluid spilled, he said.

 A post from Middletown police claims surrounding cities, counties and states are sending members of their homeless populations to the Butler County city to "discard" them. Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw "Most of our homeless are not from here," Middletown Police Chief Rodney Muterspaw posted on Facebook on Tuesday. "We have a huge problem with other cities (they know who they are), dumping homeless people here because they don't want them in their city." Muterspaw went on to say many homeless people are given vouchers for a cab ride from another city and sent to Middletown, or are even dropped off in Middletown by other cities' police agencies. Many are dropped off at bus stations or in front of homeless shelters after they are closed for the night, around 1 a.m., the post states. Middletown has multiple shelters for the homeless, including SHALOM, Hope House and the Dream Center – Feed the Hungry Project. "They see we have the shelters mentioned above and just dump people, like cattle, here and say, 'See ya'. It is inhumane and it is irresponsible," he wrote in the post. Mitchell Foster, executive director of Hope House Mission, said that Muterspaw's evaluation was right, about a third of the homeless he serves are not from the area. Foster said that of the 409 men and women who came through the shelter in the past 12 months, 135 were not from Middletown or Butler County at all. At total of 191 were from Middletown and 83 were from other areas of Butler County. Deborah Patterson, director of Dream Center – Feed the Hungry Project, feeds about 100 people each night. She says about 70 percent are homeless, but she does not track where they come from. In response to Muterspaw's comments, Patterson said she would start asking her clients where they come from. SHALOM is closed until December and could not be reached for comment. According to Muterspaw, bringing this issue to the public's attention is "way overdue." "This trend of dumping homeless people in Middletown has to stop," Muterspaw said in the Facebook post. "Cities should do everything they can to help them, not discard them."

 The search for answers to the mysterious lung disease apparently related to vaping goes through a low-slung building in an industrial park in a northern Cincinnati neighborhood. The Forensic Chemistry Center in Cincinnati operates under the authority of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, it’s a secretive place, and FDA officials declined repeated requests to tour the lab or speak with its leadership. An agency spokeswoman answered questions that The Enquirer submitted by email. In the vaping investigation, the laboratory has received more than 400 samples of vaping products from 18 states, “and those numbers continue to increase,” the FDA said. The Forensic Chemistry Center in the Cincinnati neighborhood of Bond Hill is the primary investigative laboratory for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It's now on the hunt for answers to the mysterious lung disease believed to be linked to vaping. “More than half of the vaping liquid products have undergone some form of evaluation, and additional testing on these and other samples continues daily,” the FDA said. “Many samples have contained little to no liquid, which limits the number and types of tests FDA is able to conduct on each submission.” The lab, tucked away off Paddock Road in Bond Hill, is testing the cartridges for chemicals “including nicotine, THC and other cannabinoids, opioids, cutting agents/diluents and other additives, pesticides, poisons and toxins.” “Sample results to date have not identified a single substance associated with all illnesses,” the FDA said. “Identifying compounds present in the samples associated with illnesses will be one piece of the puzzle and will not necessarily answer all questions about causality, which makes our ongoing work critical.” <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong >More stories about health care in Greater Cincinnati < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://offers.cincinnati.com/specialoffer?gps-source= CPNEWS&amp;utm_medium =onsite&amp;utm_source=news&amp;utm_campaign= NEWSROOM&amp;utm_content =ANNESAKER" target="_blank">with a digital subscription</a>.</strong></span> The lab’s Sixty scientists work at the lab.

Officials in Pike County asked for independent testing to asses the source, levels, extent and Testing will be done on schools, public properties, private properties and waters of the state within an initial 6 miles radius from the center of the plant, the health district said. "We will not accept any increased risk for our kids, teachers, or community just because we have a DOE facility in our community. Any level of contamination found above background- regardless of how small- causes an increased risk," officials in Pike County said. Department of Energy tests have found that levels of radioactivity aren't above naturally occurring levels and said there is no need for concern. "Results continue to indicate that any detections are far below the regulatory limits set by the US EPA for public health and environmental protection," a DOE official told The Enquirer Friday. The Pike County General Health District said they also wanted testing for toxic chemicals but the Department of Energy would not agree to that testing once it was included in the scope of work submitted by Solutient Technologies. When asked why the DOE did not want to test for toxic chemicals, officials said: “In May 2019 DOE agreed to fund a third-party sampling event to assuage community concerns related to radiological releases from the Portsmouth site. DOE remains committed to funding this effort." The Pike County General Health District is starting a cancer and health assessment with a local epidemiologist after "a quick review" found that local residents are more likely to develop multiple myeloma than other U.S. citizens. Through the Ohio Department of Health's Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System, Pike County officials said they found that from 2012 to 2016, the Village of Piketon zip code had 10 new cases of multiple myeloma. "According to the Cancer Network, the incidence rate is 2.1 cases per 100,000. According to the National Institute of Health, the incidence rate is 5 cases per 100,000," officials said. "This is not a scientific analysis and the health district won’t speculate at the cause, this is simply using math and looking at the rates we have compared to what they say we should have in our area," officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told local officials they would not be involved in a study of that nature until the independent, third-party assessment is complete, Pike County officials said. After the results are in, the CDC will decide if it will be involved.

 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assessing communities near current or former military bases and that are known to have had PFAS in their drinking water. COLUMBUS The manmade chemicals known as PFAS have been turning up in drinking water and some foods across the U.S. The chemicals are used in products ranging from carpeting, cookware, microwave popcorn bags and firefighting foam. Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency will coordinate the testing of nearly 1,500 public water systems serving communities, schools, day cares and mobile home parks. A PFAS-containing sample water is taken during work at Michigan State University's Fraunhofer Center for Coatings and Diamond Technologies on Sept. 13, 2018. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Robert Bilott: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/12/02/dark-waters-robert-bilott -continues-legal-battle-against-forever-chemicals/4350427002/" target="_blank">Cincinnati attorney featured in ‘Dark Waters’ movie continues legal battle against forever chemicals</a></span> If the chemicals are detected, the OEPA will work with public systems to reduce their levels.

But some researchers and activists warn that it could also bring a new type of pollution to the Ohio River Valley – nurdles. Nurdles are tiny plastic pellets similar in size to a lentil and produced at petrochemical plants. They’re the raw material of the plastics industry, the building blocks of everything from car parts to keyboards to grocery store bags. Jace Tunnell is the reserve director at the Marine Science Institute at the University of Texas at Austin. Before last year, he had only heard of nurdles. But walking along the beach at Corpus Christi, Texas, in 2018, he saw nurdles littering the high tide line. “And at first, I wasn't sure, you know, are they fish eggs?” Tunnell said. “...When I picked one up and squeezed it, it was really hard. I knew exactly what that was. It was a nurdle.” Tunnell described it as unbelievable how many opaque pellets he saw on the beach. There were thousands, likely more. “I was kind of in shock,” he said. Tunnell sought to better understand nurdle pollution: How many of these were really washing up on the Texas Gulf Coast? So, he started surveying the beaches. He also created Nurdle Patrol, a citizen science project that teaches people how to find nurdles and document their presence. The protocol: If a nurdle is found, start the clock and search for 10 minutes. Then input the total number collected into Nurdle Patrol’s database. Boy Scout troops, families and others have done surveys along the Gulf Coast. One thing Tunnell has learned from this: “Almost every single beach that you go to has pellets on it,” he said. “These pellets don't break down over time,” he said, adding that it can take hundreds of years for nurdles to break into smaller pieces. When birds, fish and other species eat bits of plastic, it can make them think they’re full and die of malnutrition. Microplastics, including nurdles, are also known to attract toxins that can accumulate in wildlife. One study found some fish sold for human consumption in the United States contained plastic debris. The World Health Organization says more research is needed on the health impacts to humans. Plastic production is ramping up nationally. Fueled by the boom of shale gas production, 334 projects related to plastics have been announced since 2010, according to the American Chemistry Council [ACC], a trade group that includes the plastics industry. One of those projects is the ethane cracker Shell is building along the Ohio River in Beaver County, north of Pittsburgh. It will take ethane from the region’s natural gas to produce nearly 1.6 million metric tons of plastic pellets a year. That equals an estimated trillions of nurdles annually. In an email, Shell says it has pledged to prevent accidental loss of plastic pellets from its manufacturing facility into the environment, using industry safety and production measures. The ACC along with the Plastics Industry Association run a program called Operation Clean Sweep, developed by the plastics industry. Shell is a member of Operation Clean Sweep. “Our goal is to move towards zero pellet loss to the environment,” said Keith Christman, the ACC’s managing director of plastics markets. But environmental groups have doubts. These tanks, shown here in June 2019, will hold the plastic pellets produced by Shell’s ethane cracker. According to Shell, 1.6 million metric tons of plastic will be produced there annually. Shell is building a cracker along the Ohio River in Beaver County, north of Pittsburg “I think that once this facility is up and running, people will start to see tiny little bits of plastic, these nurdles that are lining the waterways where the stormwater drains into,” said Emily Jeffers, attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “Once you see them, you're going to see millions of them.” It’s easy for these tiny, lightweight pellets to escape into the environment. When millions of pellets are being loaded into trucks, train cars or ships for transport, they easily spill. When it rains, these spilled pellets can wash into waterways. The Center for Biological Diversity submitted a legal petition supported by 280 environmental, public health, Indigenous and community groups around the country to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] in July. Among other things, Jeffers said they want regulations revised to specifically prohibit discharge of nurdles into waterways. “And so we've petitioned the EPA to upgrade the standards, which are 40 years old,” Jeffers said, “...because this industry has been ignored for decades. And the standards in place now don't protect humans or the environment.” Good River: Stories of the Ohio is a series about the environment, economy and culture of the
Ohio River watershed, produced by seven nonprofit newsrooms. To see more, please visit
ohiowatershed.org. To bolster her point, Jeffers pointed to Lavaca Bay, Texas, a couple hours drive north of Corpus Christi, where Tunnell first found nurdles on the beach. In October, Formosa Plastics settled a lawsuit with Lavaca Bay residents and environmental activists for $50 million after a judge ruled the company illegally discharged billions of plastic pellets. Residents there had urged state and federal regulators to hold Formosa accountable for a decade. “Yes, there are standards right now,” Jeffers said. “They're just woefully out of date.” According to an EPA spokesperson, the agency is considering the petition. Manufacturers don’t want their product to escape, Christman said. “Let's remember that this material is very valuable. It's something that our members want to keep control over,” he said. Operation Clean Sweep has developed best practices for plastic makers, like how to design a facility and train employees to avoid pellet spills and how to clean up if spills do happen. Christman said there’s no need for the EPA to create new rules prohibiting nurdle loss. “It is already regulated through the Clean Water Act and stormwater permits, so this material and loss of it at a facility is regulated already,” he said. In Texas, Tunnell wants water permits for plastic manufacturers to be clear that the goal is no pellet loss. Despite the efforts of Operation Clean Sweep, nurdles continue to accumulate in waterways in Europe, Australia and the United States. “That tells me that the voluntary program is not working,” he said. “And so what happens when education doesn't work anymore and voluntary programs don't work any more? Then you need to go to stricter regulations.” Tunnell said the voluntary best management practices laid out by Operation Clean Sweep should be enforced as regulations. California is the only state to specifically regulate nurdles. Nurdles along the shores of Galveston Bay in Texas, home to many petrochemical plants, which can inadvertently spill pellets. As the plastics industry gears up in the Ohio Valley, regulators say water permits for the crackers in Beaver County and Belmont County, Ohio, already address nurdle pollution. Elizabeth Rementer, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection [DEP], wrote in an email that the state is not considering adding a zero pellet requirement to permits. She pointed to the state’s regulations that limit floating material, like nurdles, from entering waterways in amounts that could be harmful to humans or wildlife. “If nurdles were being discharged in an industrial effluent to surface water, the Department would restrict or eliminate the discharge,” according to Rementer’s email. The agency did not respond to a request for an interview. DEP’s water discharge permit for the Shell cracker outlines best management practices for stormwater, but does not list nurdles or plastic pellets specifically. “The facility’s plans include a stormwater collection system that would capture any spilled plastics prior to their entry into their stormwater system,” according to Rementer’s email. “In addition, stormwater flowing from potentially contaminated areas on the site are treated prior to their discharge under Shell’s NPDES permit, further minimizing the risk of nurdle discharges.” In Ohio, the state EPA last year approved water permits for another ethane cracker in Belmont County, southwest of Pittsburgh, near Wheeling, West Virginia. In an email, the Ohio EPA said the plant will include secondary containment and catch basins with screens to prevent nurdles from being discharged into the Ohio River. Christman with Operation Clean Sweep said it is rolling out a new program next year to its members, including Shell, to better track pellet loss. “Members … will submit data [to] state regulatory agencies on the amount of pellets lost to the environment due to an accidental release and the amount of material recovered within a facility handling resin pellets that's recycled.” More than 15 organizations in the Ohio River watershed have signed the Center for Biological Diversity’s petition demanding more regulation of nurdles from petrochemical plants. “I am extremely concerned about plastics and especially microplastics and nurdles,” said Randi Pokladnik, a representative of the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition, one of the groups that signed the petition. “We do need to get some baseline data on the Ohio.” Tunnell recommended that people in Pennsylvania and Ohio use his Nurdle Patrol protocol to gather data before petrochemical plants start operating. Showing that there are no nurdles on the banks of the Ohio River now can be a powerful tool to hold industry accountable later, he said. “Even zeros are data.” Help tell stories that envision a better future for the Ohio River.

 A hazmat crew assesses the mock chemical spill at Ohio University Chillicothe on Saturday, May 5, 2018. The scenario involved a chemical spill at the railroad overpass on OH 180, next to Zane Trace Schools, where an Adena school bus going to a Zane Trace basketball game comes across the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals. There are hundreds of companies in Northern Kentucky that hold toxic chemicals. But there are 23 that emergency workers think pose a "greater vulnerability," than the rest if the toxic chemicals leaked. Where are they? Good question. State law won't let The Enquirer know, or tell you, which companies pose the most risk. Or where they are, or what schools, housing developments and highways they might be near. Kentucky open records laws prevents that information from disclosure when there’s a chance it could threaten public safety and hinder “protecting against, mitigating, or responding to a terrorist act.” That exemption was added in 2005. The list of companies, however, are all on a special list watched by emergency workers. Hebron Fire Assistant Fire Chief William Fletcher knows which companies they are because of his role as Vice-Chair of the Northern Kentucky Emergency Planning Committee. That regional group monitors companies’ chemical leak emergency plans in five counties: Boone, Kenton, Campbell, Gallatin and Pendleton. "Sleep well knowing there are folks doing good work for the safety and well being for the community," said chairman Rodney Bell, who is also the Occupational Safety & Health Senior Manager at Sanitation District No. 1. The group collected emergency action plans from 350 companies in Northern Kentucky. That way, the regional committee can share information to help local fire departments best respond to a chemical spill. About a third of the companies are in the category reserved only for entities that hold "extremely" hazardous substances. The 23 that posed the most risk are on that list. Last fall, the White Castle facility in Covington had an airborne chemical release, Fletcher recalled. The emergency response plan helped firefighters who diluted the gaseous leak with their hoses. A resident can request to see a specific company's emergency response plan but Fletcher would not be able to disclose the volume of chemicals that company has. If a company doesn’t submit an emergency response report, there’s a $250 penalty to pay in addition to the original filing fee which spans from $40 to $250. All of the Northern Kentucky companies on Fletcher’s list avoided the penalty fee this year. Most are only on the list because of how many industrial batteries they have, like Amazon, Others made the list because of how much diesel fuel they had on-site, including the FedEx distribution center. Even though Fletcher couldn't disclose which companies pose the most danger, he showed The Enquirer which tools are used to prepare for catastrophic events. A computer program let Fletcher click and drag scenarios onto a Northern Kentucky map. Then it quickly displayed the emergency response plan, including radius impacted and how many people were in that area. “Knowing what’s out there helps us prepare,” Fletcher said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > Julia is the new Northern Kentucky government reporter through the Report For America program.

 The Memphis Sand aquifer provides some of the best drinking water in North America, but what is it? March 04, 2019 - A view of the retired Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant. Memphis' Sand aquifer is sitting below one of the most polluted coal ash landfills in the country, and levels of arsenic found in the nearby groundwater are 350 times higher than what is considered safe, according to a study by the Environmental Integrity Project. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/environment/2016/12/16/memphis-sand-aquifer-buried-treasure/93814278/?from =global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=">Memphis ' Sand aquifer</a> The report analyzed industry data available to the public for the first time, as a result of an Obama-era coal regulation that took effect in 2015. Ten power plants across the nation were identified as having the highest levels of pollutants found in groundwater near coal ash ponds. The Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant is one of them. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2018/04/26/memphis-larget-polluter-tva-allen-plant-retired/543676002/">The Allen Fossil plant's three coal-powered units retired in 2018. </a> The study, released Monday, follows a recent report from the U.S. Geological Survey that revealed this contaminated groundwater is "hydraulically connected" to the Memphis Sand aquifer, the city's source for drinking water. The arsenic levels are found in the shallow aquifer. Memphis' drinking water comes from a deeper source. Separating the two is a thin layer of clay. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. However, a report released Friday by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) acknowledges the TVA is adamant the plume of contaminated groundwater is not moving towards the deep aquifer where drinking water is derived from. TVA, operators of the Allen plant, also say there is no evidence the drinking water supply contains the high levels of arsenic. Further, TVA says Memphis Light, Gas & Water has been unable to find evidence of high concentrations of arsenic in the city's drinking water. TVA says they have already begun the work of finding a solution that meets federal guidelines. After learning of the arsenic levels present in the groundwater, Rep. Steve Cohen is calling for a congressional hearing from the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in order to examine the "impact and effects of all coal ash plants and coal ash dumps on groundwater quality, human health, and aquatic life," according to a letter released by Cohen. "If this is true," Cohen wrote, "it is obviously alarming." March 04, 2019 - A view of the retired Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant. Memphis' Sand aquifer is sitting below one of the most polluted coal ash landfills in the country, and levels of arsenic found in the nearby groundwater are 350 times higher than what is considered safe, according to a study by the Environmental Integrity Project. According to their website, the Environmental Integrity Project is a nonpartisan, nonprofit environmental watchdog group comprised of public interest attorneys, investigators, industry analysts and community activists. Their report identifies coal plants containing high levels of pollutants and also provides recommended guidelines for eliminating toxic threats coming from coal ash ponds. The report isn't exactly a surprise to Scott Banbury, the conservation program coordinator for Tennessee's Sierra Club chapter. "Removing this threat to our city's drinking water should be a top priority for all elected officials in Shelby County and Tennessee," Banbury said. "We hope that TVA does the right thing and removes the toxic coal ash from these ponds and reinters it in an appropriately engineered landfill." Protect Our Aquifer, a civic group that has concentrated its efforts on stricter groundwater regulations and raising public awareness, has been monitoring threats to the Memphis Sand aquifer since 2016. Along with the Sierra Club, the aquifer group has been monitoring each development of not only the coal ash ponds, but also TVA efforts to draw 3.5 million gallons a day from the Memphis Sand aquifer to cool the new Allen Combined Cycle plant, powered by natural gas. March 04, 2019 - A view of the retired Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant. Memphis' Sand aquifer is sitting below one of the most polluted coal ash landfills in the country, and levels of arsenic found in the nearby groundwater are 350 times higher than what is considered safe, according to a study by the Environmental Integrity Project. The water used to cool the Combined Cycle plant would come from five wells drilled by TVA. Currently, strict limitations have been placed on the wells by the Shelby County Health Department. TVA can only use the wells for short periods for regular maintenance, research purposes, or if water from MLGW is not available and the plant is heading towards a catastrophic event. "We also hope that TVA will make the investments necessary to utilize grey water from the T.E. Maxson Sewer Treatment Plant to cool their new gas-fired electric generation facility, as originally envisioned, and forgo the use of water from our precious Memphis Sand Aquifer," Banbury said. A.C. Cox, 85, talks about his time at the Allen Fossil Plant where he started to work in 1959. TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said the report's results do not come as a surprise to them. “We don’t disagree with those numbers. This is information that we found from groundwater monitors that we installed in 2017," Brooks said. "This is an example of the CCR Rule working as it should. Once we found those elevated numbers, we reported those to TDEC." The CCR, or Coal Combustion Residuals Rule, is an Environmental Protection Agency order that requires companies operating coal plants to study whether associated pollutants that result from coal-powered plants contaminate the groundwater. In accordance with that rule, TVA has been monitoring contaminates at the Allen plant, and updated their findings as recently as Friday. Brooks said that TVA is now looking ahead, as the power supplier begins to address pollution. "TVA is conducting a remedial investigation on the arsenic exceedances found in the shallow aquifer and has provided TDEC with a recommended interim corrective action to address the environmental impacts," Brooks said. TVA also says field work on the corrective action is expected to begin in 2019 as TVA explores the best course for removing or closing the coal ash pond.

 The Memphis Sand aquifer provides some of the best drinking water in North America, but what is it? Is arsenic threatening to spike Memphians' drinking water? Perhaps not right now. But it's hard not to worry — especially since the non-partisan Environmental Integrity Project recently found that the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Allen Fossil Plant was among the nation’s top ten coal ash-contaminated sites. It found that the groundwater beneath it contained arsenic levels 350 times higher than what is considered safe. Then, there's the concern that revamped U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules on how power plants dispose of coal ash waste could lead to more lax enforcement.

 The Memphis Sand aquifer provides some of the best drinking water in North America, but what is it? Memphians like to laud their municipal water supply as one of the best in the country. It comes from a massive underground lake called the Memphis Sand aquifer. Water from the Memphis aquifer is so pure Recently, environmental groups have raised the alarm about new groundwater monitoring reports from a South Memphis power plant that, they say, show some disturbing signs. Here's what we know and what we don't know about recent testing of Memphis water. The coal ash ponds at Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant are pits dug in the earth for the purpose of storing leftover ash remnants from when the plant was active and burning coal for decades to produce energy. The plant closed in 2018. The pits are unlined, which means the coal ash — rich in elements such as arsenic, boron and sulfates — has direct contact with the dirt and the groundwater in the shallow aquifer. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/03/04/memphis-allen-fossil-power-plant-high-levels-arsenic-tennessee-valley-authority-report/3027069002/">A national report released earlier this month</a> Organizations like the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club, and Protect Our Aquifer are concerned that the contaminants found in the ash pit are in danger of seeping downward — toward the Memphis Sand aquifer. But there is no evidence to suggest that unsafe levels of arsenic are currently in the Memphis Sand aquifer or in Memphis' drinking water, and TVA says that its current data does not indicate any downward movement of the arsenic concentration. A national report released this month identified the groundwater near a coal ash pond at the Allen Fossil plant to have arsenic levels 350 times above safe levels. The plant closed last year. Between the Memphis Sand aquifer and the shallower, contaminated water above is a layer of clay that environmental groups say serves as a protective barrier between the two sources of water. Environmentalists expressed concern in early March when TVA submitted a report to federal regulators that appeared to show a breach in the clay layer, which is also referred to as the Claiborne layer. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">TVA report:: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/breaking/2019/03/01/memphis-aquifer-not-protected-arsenic-some-parts-tva-says-coal-ash-contamination-ground-water/3034179002/">Clay barrier absent above Memphis aquifer at site near coal ash landfill</a></span> Amanda Garcia, a lead attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, says that without a naturally occurring clay barrier, the groundwater contaminated from the coal ash pond is sitting directly on top of the Memphis Sand aquifer. Garcia says this could allow the contaminants to seep into the deeper aquifer. Daniel Larsen, chair of the earth sciences department at the University of Memphis, said he's "concerned, but not alarmed" about the possible holes in the clay layer. Larsen, like Garcia, believes more research of the clay layer is necessary, but he has not seen any evidence that suggests the contaminated water is moving deeper. Further, TVA says, its research shows there is a layer of "blue clay" in the shallow aquifer that is a thick layer of clay, silt and sand that helps limit the downward motion of contaminated water. TVA says the arsenic concentrations are in the shallow aquifer, and there is no evidence of a "downward plume" of contaminants. Garcia and Larsen say a closer look at the area is needed to be sure that pollutants are not making their way to the deeper water source. The aquifer, Larsen said, is not a simple geographical feature. It's complicated, and the movement of water is anything but one-directional. "Unless there's a big pumping source, water moves in all different directions," Larsen said. While arsenic is the most recognizable threat, Garcia explains that there are better indicators of water movement in the shallow aquifer. Boron is one of those. Boron, according to Garcia, is an element that can serve as a strong indicator of water movement. Scientists can look at the coal ash byproduct to help understand where water has the potential to move. "We have deeper well data from the state investigation that shows levels of boron and sulfate deep within the shallow aquifer," Garcia said. TVA reports show elevated levels of boron in the deepest part of the shallow aquifer around the ground monitoring wells, something that Garcia says emphasizes the need for more research. A diagram from the Southern Environmental Law Center depicts where the contaminated groundwater was found and its proximity to the Memphis Sand aquifer — our drinking water source. Unfortunately, says Garcia, no one can answer questions about the potential trajectory of the contaminants with certainty yet, which is why organizations like the center, as well as the civic group Protect Our Aquifer and the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club are pushing for TVA to conduct more research. Larsen also would like to see TVA take further investigative action. "I think TVA needs to put in some additional Memphis aquifer monitoring wells and investigate," Larsen said. "We told them that is important. I think they know it.

Larsen is hopeful the study will answer some of the more pressing questions around the safety of Memphis drinking water. But Larsen draws comfort from what he already knows about the nature of water — it moves slowly underground. "It’s 2½ miles from where there is arsenic to the production Davis well field at MLGW," Larsen said. "It could take some 40, 60, even 70 years to travel that distance."

 A.C. Cox, 85, talks about his time at the Allen Fossil Plant where he started to work in 1959. Removal is the preferred option for dealing with coal ash stored at the Allen Fossil Plant in Memphis, the Tennessee Valley Authority announced Wednesday. The TVA is still considering whether to dispose of the coal ash by transporting it to a facility to be processed for use in concrete and other building materials or by transporting it to an offsite landfill, The plant's three coal-fired units were retired in March 2018, but an estimated 3 million cubic yards of coal ash and other coal combustion residuals remain at the site. The TVA rejected the idea of “closure-in-place,” leaving the ash there but removing most of the moisture and capping it. “There are a lot of considerations still in the process: How much of it can we reuse, where would the beneficial reuse take place, where would we take the leftover?” said Scott Brooks, spokesman for the TVA. “We are in the middle of multiple processes, all of which are working at the same time with the goal of getting that property to a condition where it can be reused. That’s the goal.” A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">TVA report: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/breaking/2019/03/01/memphis-aquifer-not-protected-arsenic-some-parts-tva-says-coal-ash-contamination-ground-water/3034179002/">Clay barrier absent above Memphis aquifer at site near coal ash landfill</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">Allen Fossil Plant: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/03/04/memphis-allen-fossil-power-plant-high-levels-arsenic-tennessee-valley-authority-report/3027069002/">Water near coal ash dump ranked among worst in the country for arsenic contamination</a></span > Also on Wednesday, State Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, TVA will continue drafting their environmental impact statement, which will also be available for public review and comment. That draft will be available for a minimum of 45 days of public comment and review before TVA publishes a final environmental impact statement. After a period of 30 days, they will determine the best way to manage the ash. That decision could come as early as the spring of 2020. Wednesday’s announcement, one piece in a lengthy process of determining how to deal with the ash, came less than a month after the Environmental Integrity Project released a study listing the Allen Fossil Plant among the top 10 power plants in the nation with the That study followed a report from the U.S. Geological Survey that revealed the contaminated groundwater — which includes levels of arsenic at levels 350 times higher than those considered safe — is “ The Memphis Sand aquifer provides some of the best drinking water in North America, but what is it? The arsenic levels are found in the shallow aquifer. Memphis' drinking water comes from a deeper source. Separating the two is a thin layer of clay. However, a report released earlier this month by the TVA acknowledged the clay barrier separating the shallow aquifer from the deeper Memphis Sand aquifer is absent in a testing site near the coal ash pond. TVA is adamant the plume of contaminated groundwater is not moving towards the deep aquifer where drinking water is derived from. U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen criticized the amount of time it could take for cleanup at the Allen Fossil Plant in a letter sent to the TVA on Tuesday. “While it was my understanding that corrective work will begin this year, I was alarmed to learn at the meeting that cleanup could take as long as 20 years,” Cohen wrote. “… By the time corrective action begins, it will have taken almost four years since TVA’s groundwater monitoring revealed the pollution to begin appropriate corrective action and much longer to complete the cleanup.” A view of the retired Tennessee Valley Authority's Allen Fossil plant. The Memphis Sand aquifer is sitting below one of the most polluted coal ash landfills in the country. Brooks said if all goes well, removing the coal ash could take around 10 years. Environmental remediation of groundwater contamination could take longer, he said. Ward Archer, president of Protect Our Aquifer, said he feels like TVA isn’t treating the ash removal with enough urgency. He would like to see TVA hire someone based in Memphis to manage the removal of the ash at the Allen Fossil Plant, he said. “I think having a singular person in charge on the ground here could help perhaps cut some red tape and find ways to expedite this,” Archer said. <em>Reporter Micaela Watts contributed to this article. </em> <em>Katherine Burgess covers county government and the suburbs.

 The Tennessee Valley Authority is ready to clean up and demolish the Allen Fossil plant in South Memphis. But plans to do so are drawing concern from environmental groups that say the cleanup process has not been publicly vetted and involves pumping dangerous amounts of arsenic solids into the Mississippi River. Inactive since March 2018, the once coal-powered Allen plant still contains an estimated 3 million cubic yards of coal ash waste and other combustible residuals. The water near and in these coal ash pits, and their stilling ponds,  were recently ranked <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/03/27/tva-plans-remove-coal-ash-allen-fossil-plant/3292995002/" target="_blank">TVA has said its preferred option for cleaning up</a> In a letter submitted to the Tennessee Valley Authority and Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the SELC lists several objections to the plans for cleaning up Allen. TVA spokesperson Scott Brooks said while the agency has not "officially" reviewed the SELC letter, the objections are "scare tactics without science." Under the current plan, the SELC says, water from the coal ash ponds that is contaminated with high amounts of arsenic will be pumped through an open-air channel into the Mississippi River, just downstream of Downtown Memphis. The water in question is referred to in the letter as pore water, which is "the water trapped within the void space between ash particles," according to a previous TVA report. "By TVA's own admission," the Southern Environmental Law Center letter said, "concentrations of arsenic in its pore water range up to 13,700 micrograms per liter (of water), with an average of 1,350 micrograms per liter, in other words, concentrations of arsenic over a thousand times the safe level for drinking water." SELC used these figures, added in the maximum amount of water allowed daily under the dewatering plan, 15 million gallons a day, and concluded, "TVA could be dumping hundreds of pounds of arsenic into the surrounding surface waters every day." Further, the SELC says, the Tennessee Valley Authority plan does not treat the pore water before discharge, unless the concentration of arsenic exceeds 12,600 micrograms per liter. TVA also cites 12,600 micrograms per liter as the point of contamination, but it says not only is it an acceptable level, according to United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, but that it's actually a conservative level of arsenic before decontamination efforts are triggered. "That’s actually 80% of what is considered a safe level by EPA, so we are being more conservative than required," Brooks said. The SELC also says the dewatering plan is taking place under an invalid permit, but the state approved the plan anyway. The state website lists TVA's permit as having expired in 2010 but is under "re-issuance. " The SELC wants a new permit approval process for the dewatering plan, one that is vetted by the public. Certain types of groundwater discharge, as well as the discharge point where the water would drain into the Mississippi, are not valid under the current permit, the SELC says. The state, Brooks says, chose to administratively continue the existing permit. Further, he said, the plan to dewater the Allen plant was available for public discussion in open houses hosted by the TVA last year. Kim Schofinski with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation told The Commercial Appeal that the 2007 permit was continued and still valid. "We want people to know that TVA is taking every precaution to be protective of the environment and the community," Brooks said. "We have committed to remediate the site, and this dewatering is the next step to be able to remove the coal ash and make the site available for future economic development." Scott Banbury with the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club disputes the idea that environmental groups are trying to produce scare tactics. Rather, Banbury said, groups are calling attention to an intricate and delicate environmental remediation process that should be heavily scrutinized. Banbury says it's a process that should be slowed down, and subject to public meetings. "The fact that TVA would try to approve an action like this as an addendum of an expired permit," Banbury said, "it's affront to the people of Memphis."

 The Southaven Fire Department clears the scene after county official prematurely called a gas leak warning after a gas line was hit during construction on Thursday, Aug. 22, 2019. Memphis — A gas leak warning was canceled after a brief scare in Southaven Thursday morning. Desoto County Emergency Services reported the warning was canceled about 10:50 a.m., less than an hour after a report from the Desoto County Sheriff's Department announced the alert. The location of the leak was near the intersection of Cherry Place and Kenton Drive. The sheriff's department called for residents to "shelter in place" and recommended residents call 911 for any emergencies. Clayton Palmoore said he has lived in the neighborhood for a year. He got home around the time first responders were addressing the gas leak issue. He was told that C-Spire contracted a company to lay fiber optic cables. He believes the gas leak happened an hour before he arrived at his home. "I don't think it was that bad," said Palmoore. "When I got here, I had to park my car on Cherry and they said I could walk to my house but they did not want any vehicles over here." Corner of Cherry place and Kenton Drive in Southaven, Mississippi. David Mcgraw, who stays just a block away from Palmoore, said the gas leak was minor compared to what authorities reported. "I'd hate to see a [major] gas leak cause that wasn't major, that was minor," Mcgraw said laughingly. His wife, Gladys, was walking her dog at the time of the leak. She also said C-Spire was working in the streets of the neighborhood prior to the gas leak. She was told to leave her home and wait at a nearby by facility while the leak was being resolved. After the alert was canceled, Tish Clark Dunning, public information officer for City of Southaven, said county officials might have acted hastily by sending out the alert before the situation was fully understood. Dunning described the leak as a "routine" construction-related error that would not normally have triggered such an alert by city officials. <em > The Commercial Appeal will update this story as more information becomes available.</em>

 Three dogs died hours after playing at a pond in North Carolina with blue-green algae. The owners want to bring awareness to others. Shelby Farms Park said Thursday it has been unable to discern the cause of death of two dogs after playing in the Outback Dog Park within Shelby Farms. The park also said they are awaiting lab results from tests of the water at the dog park. "In addition to lab testing, we are working with multiple partners to ensure that we have the most accurate information about our lake ecosystems," according to a statement from park officials. Out of an abundance of caution, we are closing the lakes in The Outback. " The closure comes hours after a Facebook post claimed two dogs died shortly after playing in the dog park lake at Shelby Farms park went Memphis-viral on Wednesday, prompting thousands of shares among anxious dog owners and a response from the park. The post accumulated thousands of shares within hours, and a variety of responses from Memphians who said they would err on the side of caution and keep their pets from playing in the dog park until more information was known. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">NORTH CAROLINA CASE: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/nation/2019/08/13/blue-green-algae-kills-dogs-north-carolina-pond-owner-says/1995217001/ " target="_blank">A couple took their 3 dogs to a pond.

On Aug. 13, before any allegations of dog fatalities surfaced, the park informed the public in a Facebook post that they were aware of reports of toxic algae found in bodies of water in several states, including Tennessee, but said that no such algae had been found anywhere within the park. The post also said the park routinely tests the bodies of water within the entire park, and would continue to closely monitor the dog park as an extra precaution.

In North Carolina, one woman said all three of her dogs died within hours of being exposed to toxic algae blooms in Wilmington, North Carolina. Wilhelm said the best way to avoid deadly algae is to look before you or your pets swim in water.

 Shelby Farms algae testing update Shelby Farms Park confirms two dogs that died last week after visiting the Outback Dog Park did not die from exposure to toxic algae in pond water, as one Facebook post that went viral said. However, because the issue of toxic algae in bodies of water has been prevalent throughout the U.S. this summer, the park is opting to keep the Outback Dog Park closed in "an abundance of caution," Shelby Farms Park officials told The Commercial Appeal. The now-deleted Facebook post was shared thousands of times, but no dog owners had contacted park officials, which presented an obstacle in verifying the claims of canine deaths due to toxic algae. But after just enough pieces of information came to light, park officials were able to track down the veterinarian that treated the dogs centered in the Facebook post, said Rebecca Dailey, the communications coordinator for the park. Rebecca Dailey, communications coordinator at Shelby Farms Park, on the park grounds Monday, Aug. 26, 2019. The veterinarian confirmed the two dogs  died from heat exposure. And results of testing of the pond showed little or no detectable toxicity. Further, no veterinarians in the Memphis area reported any cases of algae toxin exposure, park officials said. Park officials declined to share information about the vet or owners, citing concern for their confidentiality. Dailey said the park had already been testing for levels of toxins from blue-green algae blooms when the Facebook post went viral. While park officials worked to verify the dogs' owner and cause of death, additional rounds of testing of the water in Outback Dog Park were ordered. The results came in Monday. "Those results show that fluctuating levels of toxins present in the ponds in the Outback Dog Park range from non-detectable to non-dangerous based on the EPA standard for human contact," said Dailey. Still, she adds, the EPA standards are for humans, and Shelby Farms officials know dogs have an invisible standard they can't measure. "So because dogs tend to drink the pond water, or lick their fur after swimming, we just decided it was better to keep the pond closed off," Dailey said. The park does not yet know when they will re-open the pond, because of weather variables like heat and precipitation that can influence the rate and quantity of algae growth. While the pond in the Outback Dog Park is closed, park officials will be consulting with other parks across the country, "to determine the absolute best practices we can be doing," said Dailey. Angie Whitfield, the marketing and communication director for the park called the experience from post to closure "largely positive," and said the vast majority of Memphians that reached out to the park via social media were positive, and appreciative that the park was meeting the issue with ample caution. "People love their dogs, and we love them too," Whitfield said, " And we've decided that there's no such thing as too much caution when it comes to pet safety. "

 Shelby Farms algae testing update Recent testing of Rainbow Lake water revealed a minimal presence of toxins produced by blue-green algae, according to Overton Park Conservancy. The levels are considered non-harmful by EPA standards, the park said. But because those standards apply to humans and not canines, park management is still urging dog owners to keep their pets out of Rainbow Lake. Dogs are more susceptible to ingesting these toxins while swimming, or licking their fur after playing in the water, the park said. Instead, the park is urging visitors to take advantage of fresh water amenities in the Overton Bark dog park. Brittany Cooper plays with her dog, Abbey, at Rainbow Lake in Overton Park in 2016. "Potable water fountains for dogs are located inside Overton Bark so they won’t need to go thirsty on their park visits," the park said. "We will be popping up some signage near the lake to remind visitors to keep dogs out of the water." The park also issued a reminder that dogs are already not allowed in the pond, in accordance with a city ordinance that requires dogs to be kept on a leash in public spaces. Reports of dogs dying after exposure to blue-green algae toxins have spiked over the summer, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

 Angela Austin, construction manager at the Allen Fossil Plant, describes plans for handling coal ash at the Allen Fossil Plant. Massive black pipes snake alongside the coal ash ponds at the Allen Fossil Plant. Two weeks ago, the Tennessee Valley Authority began the process of dewatering the east pond where ash was stored: pumping out water, treating it and releasing it to a channel that leads into the Mississippi River. So far, they’ve treated 3.7 million gallons of what is called “free water,” the water that sits freely in the pond. There is another 17 million gallons of free water to go. In the winter, they plan to begin a similar process with the pore water, the water inside the coal ash. Then, they will add activated alumina water treatment to the other treatments already in place to address arsenic in the water before it is released. “It’s very important that we get this right, because I’m the one who drinks this water too,” said Angela Austin, construction manager at the Allen Fossil Plant. A.C. Cox, 85, talks about his time at the Allen Fossil Plant where he started to work in 1959. Much is still undecided in the process of dealing with the First, the ponds need to be dewatered to make moving the coal ash manageable. The surface impoundments at the Allen Fossil Plant will be closed, including the east and west ponds, and the ash removed. Where the ash will be taken is still being determined as part of an Environmental Impact Statement, a draft of which was released Friday. Currently, the Tennessee Valley Authority is taking public comments on the statement and held an open house Monday. Another open house will be held Oct. 30 from 5-7 p.m. at the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library. Options include a permitted offsite landfill or taking much of the ash to a “re-use processing facility” where it could be used in concrete or other building materials. Other questions being considered include how to transport the material. A pump and water treatment systems sit next to the east ash pond at the Allen Fossil Plant, where the Tennessee Valley Authority has begun removing water from the ash ponds. According to the most recent draft, the TVA would prefer to dispose of the ash in an offsite landfill location by truck or rail. For now, the dewatering process continues as TVA waits to get approval to move the dry ash and waits for a location. Currently, treatment systems, pipes and green pumping equipment sit beside the east pond, where piles of ash and the occasional pocket of water is visible amid foliage. The west pond will be easier to dewater. It looks more like a park, a grassy area with scattered trees. In the spring, the TVA plans to begin remediating the groundwater, some of which is contaminated with The process will involve extraction wells placed at the north and south of the pond as well as performance monitoring wells. Moving the coal ash is expected to begin in the summer and occur simultaneously. A well monitors groundwater in the contaminated alluvial aquifer beside the east ash pond at the Allen Fossil Plant. Currently, the contaminated groundwater in the upper alluvial aquifer is being monitored by about 57 wells around the east ash pond, said Cedric Adams, project manager. The U.S Geological Survey reported the contaminated groundwater in the upper alluvial aquifer is “hydraulically connected” to the Memphis Sand aquifer, the city’s source for drinking water. The arsenic levels are found in the shallow aquifer. Memphis' drinking water comes from a deeper source. Separating the two is a layer of clay. However, a report released in March by the TVA acknowledged the clay barrier separating the shallow aquifer from the deeper Memphis Sand aquifer is absent in a testing site near the coal ash pond. Officials on Monday stressed the wells monitoring groundwater show no risk to the Memphis Aquifer. “We’re very confident they’re not reaching or migrating toward drinking water or other aspects of the environment we all might be concerned with, and we’ll continue to monitor that,” said Jeff Lyash, president and CEO of TVA. And in 2022, TVA hopes to begin dismantling the Allen Fossil Plant so the land can be repurposed. <em>Katherine Burgess covers county government, religion and the suburbs.

 Pouring water. Ten public schools in Memphis had high levels of lead in at least one water source on their campus, based on testing conducted this fall for the first time under a new state law. Most of the 18 sources were drinking fountains, but some were kitchen sinks and coolers, according to a report submitted by Shelby County Schools to the Tennessee Department of Health last week. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/08/29/memphis-area-schools-test-positive-lead-reports-show/2156183001/" target="_blank">Nearly 100 Tennessee schools found high lead levels in their water.

District leaders reported that all of the unsafe water sources have been removed. (Scroll to the bottom of this story for a full list of schools that were flagged.) “Based on the results thus far, we do not have concerns with the water quality in the district,” spokeswoman Jerica Phillips said in a statement on Wednesday.

Here are schools with at least one unsafe water source: One of the schools flagged, Charjean Elementary, is slated to close next year. Its students will be moved to a new building on the campus of Alcy Elementary School. Phillips said the district has notified the families of affected students by phone. Shelby County Schools also has contacted the local health department about the findings, which officials said were not surprising. “We have our plant managers doing a flushing of the fountains during breaks and other periods of inactivity. We’ve found this to be effective in reducing potential lead exposure,” she said.

 Children in at least 24 Shelby County Schools have potentially been exposed to drinking water with dangerous levels of lead. The district tested 3,500 drinking water sources during fall break in October. SCS is still awaiting about one-third of the test results, which should represent drinking sources at about 30 of the district's 165 schools. So far, results show 39 contaminated drinking water sources across 24 schools. That reflects about 1% of drinking water sources in the district. The district tested all sources of drinking water in schools, said Anthony Krone, a risk manager for the district. The drinking water sources that tested for unsafe levels of lead were taken out of service following the results, SCS said, and do not have any effect on any other fountains or water sources in the building. "While these individual fountains are being taken out of service, all other active water sources in these schools are still available and safe for use," the district said in a statement. Drinking water sources include kitchen faucets, ice machines and drinking fountains. In the report, "bubblers" and "coolers" are water fountains, and a "cooler" is a water fountain with cold water, Krone said. < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://publications.tnsosfiles.com/acts/110/pub/pc0977.pdf" target="_blank">A Tennessee law</a> In children, exposure to lead has been linked to damage to the central and peripheral nervous system, learning disabilities, shorter stature, impaired hearing and impaired formation and function of blood cells, Parents of students affected were notified within the state-required window, SCS said, which is five business days after the district receives the results. Parents should contact the health department with any concerns, Krone said. He also advised that parents consult health department to determine whether their children should be tested for lead. Before Tennessee passed the law requiring lead testing every two years, the district tested schools for lead in 2017. The district tested a random sampling of drinking water sources in each school, Krone said. Those results showed some drinking water sources with lead levels exceeding 20 parts per billion, and they were taken out of service and remained out of service, Krone said. The district could not immediately confirm how or if parents of students affected were notified of the 2017 testing results. Booker T.

 The Allen Fossil Plant is seen over coal ash containment ponds. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><em > This story has been updated to include additional comments from the Tennessee Valley Authority.</em></span> The Tennessee Valley Authority released a report Friday of ongoing groundwater monitoring at the inactive Allen Fossil plant, acknowledging there is an area between the shallow aquifer and the Memphis Sand aquifer without a protective clay barrier. It's unknown how wide the breach in the clay layer is. The report states: “Based on deep exploratory drilling in the vicinity of ALF-202, the upper Claiborne confining unit is absent and the Alluvial aquifer directly overlies the Memphis Sand.” Scott Brooks, a spokesperson for TVA, said that, "The potential for connectivity does not change the fact that the plume is not moving downward. Repeated testing of wells in the Memphis Sand aquifer shows no arsenic." Recent testing by Memphis Light, Gas & Water has not found evidence of unsafe levels of these pollutants, either. This is the first time TVA has publicly said that a clay layer between the monitoring well and the aquifer is absent, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center. It's not an acknowledgment to brush off, said Amanda Garcia, an attorney for the center. "It's very concerning that TVA is saying that the clay layer right along the ash pond is not there," Garcia said. TVA is currently in the process of exploring remedial options for the coal ash pits that were used by the Old Allen. The plant stopped burning coal in 2018, but concern remained among environmental groups that the coal ash pits have been leaking contaminants into groundwater. The Tennessee Valley Authority released a report Friday of ongoing groundwater monitoring at the inactive Allen Fossil plant. TVA says that there is a likelihood that the high levels of arsenic and pollutants found in the groundwater could have originated at a site other than the Allen plant. The Allen plant is in close proximity to President's Island, an area of Memphis that is largely industrial. According to Brooks, TVA placed a priority on finding the best method with which to close off the coal ash pit before figuring out where else the arsenic could be coming from. TVA acknowledged there are high levels of contaminants in the groundwater, but said those contaminants are in the shallow aquifer, not in the much deeper sand aquifer from which the City of Memphis draws its drinking water. The center has pointed to a layer of clay that has served as a buffer between the two water sources as an area in need of much more research and understanding. If any breaches are found in the clay layer, it could mean that the contaminants are being pulled from the shallow aquifer into the deeper one, according to the center. "This highlights the vulnerability of the drinking water that's coming from the sand aquifer," Garcia said. "This is indicative of an ongoing risk." A.C. Cox, 85, talks about his time at the Allen Fossil Plant where he started to work in 1959.

 The scene outside Kate Bond Middle School in Memphis on Thursday, Jan. 30, 2020 where students were evacuated due to a potential carbon monoxide leak that sickened several students. Kate Bond Middle School evacuated several hundred students Thursday due to a possible carbon monoxide leak. The school will remain closed Friday out of an abundance of caution, according to Shelby County Schools. The Memphis Fire Department initially reported four students with carbon monoxide in their system, following testing. At least six were transported to the hospital, according to Shelby County Schools' Deputy Chief of Communications Jerica Phillips. The fire department later reported the initial carbon monoxide readings may be inaccurate. "MFD tells us that their initial readings at Kate Bond Middle, along with student symptoms, indicated the presence of carbon monoxide inside the school," Shelby County Schools said in a statement. " However, MFD now tells us the presence of carbon monoxide has not been confirmed at the school and systems are still being tested. We will share more information as it becomes available." Shelby County Schools later said initial tests came back negative, and they planned to bring in an external agency Friday to run additional air quality tests. "The safety of our students, teachers, and staff is our top priority," the district said. The fire department arrived at the school around 1 p.m. to treat a sick student. Results from a blood poisoning test indicated carbon monoxide in the student's bloodstream. Several more students who indicated they were sick were also evaluated. A total of 1,150 students were evacuated from the middle school to Kate Bond Elementary School between 1 and 2 p.m., where they dismissed on a regular schedule. Parents were notified 30 to 45 minutes into the evacuation, Phillips said. Kate Bond Middle School was evacuated Thursday after several students were sickened. The cause is still being investigated. Tests were completed where the first student presented symptoms in a second floor, seventh-grade classroom. The fire department found carbon monoxide in the air at that time. The department is unsure what caused the initial elevated carbon monoxide readings. Phillips said they're awaiting test results from the fire department; Memphis, Light, Gas and Water; and Shelby County Schools' risk management teams before resuming class. Authorities initially thought the readings may have been triggered by an HVAC unit that was burning off carbon monoxide, Phillips said, but all scenarios are being tested. "They turned off all the units at first, just to figure out which unit may have been causing it," Phillips said. "And then they turned them back on and now they can't get the reading anymore. So, they're just saying, 'We have no confirmation that there was carbon monoxide.'" <em> Alexa Imani Spencer covers breaking news for The Commercial Appeal.

 Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray says 'the water is fine' in regard to the lead testing that was conducted at SCS schools. The water is fine. That's the emphatic message Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray had for parents during a media tour of Idlewild Elementary on Tuesday. To demonstrate his confidence in Idlewild's water, Ray sipped from a hallway water fountain for news cameras and explained: "I don't want the headlines to reflect something different than reality." The school system for Memphis and Shelby County voluntarily tested around 3,500 drinking water sources during fall break in October, and Shelby County Schools Superintendent Joris Ray shows a decommissioned drinking fountain found to have high levels of lead in its water at Idlewild Elementary. Water sources like this fountain have been turned off and are no longer able to be used by students. The final number of schools with questionable sources of drinking water now numbers 35 out of 165. The drinking water sources that tested positive for unsafe levels of lead were taken out of service following the results. <em><span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">► Previous reporting: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/11/07/lead-10-memphis-schools-water-testing-found-high-lead-levels/2519778001/" target="_blank">High lead levels found in the water at 10 Memphis schools</a></span></em> The Environmental Protection Agency says that there is no known "safe" level of lead. Lead exposure, the EPA says, is significantly more harmful for developing children than adults, and it has been linked to central and peripheral nervous system damage, learning disabilities, and impaired formation and function of blood cells, among other effects. The state of Tennessee passed a law earlier this year that mandates lead testing once every two years at a minimum, with the acceptable level of lead defined as less than 20 parts per billion. “I want parents to know that I would never knowingly put their children in harm's way.” Shelby County Schools voluntarily tested drinking water sources in their buildings in 2017, an effort that Ray characterized as "proactive" on Tuesday. The 2017 results also showed some drinking water sources with elevated lead levels. Those sources were taken out of service and remained out of service, according to SCS. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement. And effects of lead exposure cannot be corrected. The most important step parents, doctors, and others can take is to prevent lead exposure before it occurs." As in 2017, the water sources containing elevated levels of lead have been taken out of commission and will remain so indefinitely, Ray explained Tuesday. "I want parents to know that I would never knowingly put their children in harm's way," Ray said. In response to this year's lead testing results, SCS is pairing with the Shelby County Health Department to offer free lead testing for children. Beginning Tuesday, lead screening and testing will be available at all Shelby County Health Department clinics during regular business hours from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Additionally, SCS said a risk management team will oversee retesting of each water source in the next 90 days after any corrective actions. If those water sources are still showing elevated levels of lead, they will remain out of use until they can meet state standards. Parents can take their students to the following locations for lead testing: <em >Commercial Appeal reporter Laura Testino contributed to this report.</em>

 COLLINS, Ia. — Authorities in central Iowa say an anhydrous ammonia leak in Collins has been contained after crews were called to the scene Tuesday morning. A hazardous materials team was called to Landus Cooperative, located at 324 Railway St., just before 11 a.m. on reports of a 30,000-gallon anhydrous ammonia tank leaking. The Story County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that first responders evacuated the area in the southeast corner of Collins. The leak was stopped and the residual was contained at approximately 1:28 p.m., according to an updated release from the sheriff's office. The evacuation order has since been lifted. Responding agencies included the sheriff's office, nearby fire departments, Story County Emergency Management, and Des Moines Fire HazMat.

 VINING, Ia. — Iowa environmental officials are investigating a manure spill that led to a fish kill in east-central Iowa. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said in a news release Friday that the fish kill was found on Wolf Creek about 2 miles northwest of Vining. Department staff say a manure applicator for Mayo Farm Inc. reported Thursday morning that a drag hose leaked about 2,600 gallons of manure during land application. The applicator built a berm to dam up the spilled manure, but estimates that up to 500 gallons reached the creek. Staff saw live fish at the site Thursday, but found some dead fish just downstream were found Friday morning.

 AMES, Ia. — After class ends at 4 p.m. every Friday, Rachel Junck prepares to knock doors. Parked at Sawyer Elementary School, her old school, she looks at a map on her phone showing about a dozen homes she wants to hit before it gets too dark. "You might have heard the election in Ward 4 was so close that it's going to a runoff election," the city council candidate repeats to each willing resident, before telling them If she wins the runoff against incumbent Chris Nelson on Dec. 3, the 20-year-old chemical engineering student at Iowa State University would become the youngest woman elected to any office in state history. Her friends find that prospect exciting, she said, but she mostly brushes it off. "It'd be an honor, for sure, to have that title," she said. "But being able to represent a whole different generation of people on the council would be, I think, a bigger honor." Junck, the daughter of two Ames school teachers, said she can represent both lifelong residents and Iowa State students, who hail from every county in Iowa, every state in the country, and from 115 countries to make up about half of the city's population. Rachel Junck, a 20-year-old Iowa State University student, is challenging the 4th Ward incumbent on Ames City Council in a runoff election on Dec. 3. If elected, she will be the youngest woman elected to office in Iowa history. Her twin sister, Taylor, who Junck emphasizes is older by only minutes, studies biomedical engineering at the University of Iowa. Her younger brother, Scott, is also a Hawkeye. "Yep, they're traitors," Junck jokes. Nelson, 47, who has represented the 4th Ward since 2014, also has deep Ames roots. His ancestors settled in the Ames area before the city was founded, he said. He and his wife are Iowa State alumni — like Junck , Nelson studied chemical engineering as an undergrad — and their three children attend Ames schools. His years away from Ames, while attending the University of Iowa for a second master's degree and working in Chicago and Des Moines, gave him a "fresh set of perspectives," he said. "When it came time to settle down, my wife and I decided that Ames was where we wanted to be," said Nelson, vice president of the Nelson Electric Company. Chris Nelson, 47, is the incumbent city councilman in Ames' 4th Ward. He is vice president of the Nelson Electric Company and a graduate of Ames High School, Iowa State University and the University of Iowa. Neither hoped for a runoff, but it's not uncommon in races with three or more candidates. Still, Junck was nearly able to avert it on Nov. 5, pulling in 604 votes, or 49.51%. Just seven more votes would have provided her the 50%-plus-one-vote majority needed to win, Nelson finished with 34.34%, or 419 votes. Fewer than 200 votes were cast for a third candidate, Joe Van Erdewyk. Junck's age, she said, was met with some skepticism from voters who questioned whether a student has enough time to sit on the council. Junck says her aggressive campaigning schedule proves she can do it. "Now, with winning a lot of votes, I definitely think I'm seen as a legitimate candidate," she said. Nelson's campaign doesn't see Junck's age as disqualifying, he said. "You can't rest on your laurels," Nelson said. "I don't take anything for granted, and I respect all my opponents." Nelson said his strategy before Dec. 3 is to communicate his "knowledge, experience, perspective and beliefs that have been good additions to the council," he said. In the past six years, he's also acted as a "mediator to bring consensus on issues" within the council, he said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">► More : </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/2019/09/23/ames-pushes-back-federal-crosswalk-request/2422227001/" target="_blank">Ames pushes back on federal request to change crosswalks</a></span> Both candidates say they have sustainability goals for the 4th Ward. Nelson said sustainability has improved during his tenure, and he will make continuing those efforts a major priority. Junck agreed that Ames has seen positive movement on sustainable issues. Recently, Ames Electric Services began offering monthly credits to customers who make a one-time $300 investment in a local But Junck wants Ames to be carbon neutral. "Climate change is really important to me," she said. "Taking local action and making sure we have climate action plans so we can start to lower our emissions over the years is something that I've really brought to the conversation. ... I think there are more concrete steps we can take." Spotting a purple yard sign bearing her name, Junck excitedly knocks the door of her second-grade teacher. She ditches her usual runoff explanation for a friendly greeting, opting to come inside and warm up for a couple of minutes. Veralynn Schilling, Junck's former teacher, and her husband, Kevin Schilling, a former Iowa State music professor, recalled how excited they were to vote absentee for her — only to call from out of state to check the results and learn of how close she came to a majority.

 PFAS contamination is not a Michigan problem but also a nationwide problem. A former Rockford shoe factory that for decades used potentially health-harming PFAS compounds, causing widespread environmental contamination nearby, is nearing a $69.5 million settlement with the state of Michigan and Plainfield and Algoma townships. Under preliminary terms of the not-yet-finalized deal, Wolverine Worldwide would agree to pay for an extension of municipal water supplies to more than 1,000 properties whose wells were tainted with the nonstick "forever chemicals," which do not break down in nature and can cause cancer and other serious health effects. Hundreds of barrels of dirt sample collected from a former Wolverine World Wide tannery site in Rockford, March 1, 2019. The company will also be required to continue remediation efforts along House Street and at its former tannery site in Rockford, and contribute toward Plainfield Township's municipal PFAS filtration system and a new well field. The tannery closed in 2009 and was demolished the following year. PFAS was used in a host of industrial and consumer products, from aqueous firefighting foam to nonstick, Teflon pots and pans; Gore-Tex waterproof clothing; ScotchGard stain and water protectants, and even sandwich wrappers, microwave popcorn bags and dental floss. Scientists now, however, understand the chemicals' persistence, and the compounds have been linked to health problems including cancer, thyroid and liver disorders, and more. Roughly 70 Michigan locations have PFAS compounds in groundwater that exceed the EPA's 70 parts-per-trillion health advisory level. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy  has estimated PFAS could be found at more than 11,300 sites in Michigan — fire stations, municipal airports, military sites, refineries and bulk petroleum stations, wastewater treatment plants, old landfills, and various industrial sites. Seventeen rivers, lakes, streams and ponds throughout Michigan have "do not eat" fish advisories, or limitations on consumption of fish, because of PFOS contamination, including Saginaw Bay, Lake St. Clair and portions of the Au Sable, Huron, Flint, Saginaw and St. Joseph rivers. The settlement would resolve a federal lawsuit filed against the shoe maker by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, that was later joined by the two townships. "I am pleased to see progress toward getting relief for the residents and the environment in north Kent County," Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement Tuesday. "PFAS contamination is a serious environmental problem that demands action, and I am proud that Michigan is leading the nation in efforts to combat PFAS contamination." The settlement does not resolve multiple class-action and individual lawsuits filed against Wolverine by residents who were exposed to PFAS through their well water. Wolverine Worldwide Chairman, CEO and President Blake W. Krueger said the settlement terms not only provide benefits to the local community, but are "the right decision and path forward for the company." "The municipal water extension and other actions will help reduce future litigation and remediation costs, and resolve the pending regulatory litigation," he said. "We also expect this to improve our legal position in other pending cases. "Just as important, these actions support our efforts to resolve this legacy matter quickly." Krueger said Wolverine remains in mediation discussions with 3M, the Minnesota company that manufactured PFAS compounds, including those in the ScotchGard water repellent used on the Rockford factory's Hush Puppies shoes. Wolverine also plans to continue to "vigorously pursue recoveries from our insurance carriers," he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Wolverine would be required to continue to maintain water filtration systems for those affected homes not receiving the municipal water extension. Plainfield Township, which would manage the construction of the extended municipal water system and then its operation, intends to begin construction next year. The project is expected to take five years, with the most significantly polluted areas prioritized. Wolverine earlier this year began installing a filtration system to capture and treat groundwater on the nearby Rogue River. Foam at the Rockford Dam just downriver from the former Wolverine tannery last year tested at more than 296,000 parts per trillion for PFAS compounds. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has set a health advisory level for PFAS compounds PFOS and PFOA of 70 parts per trillion in drinking water. Wolverine also has worked with the EPA to begin excavation of soils, sediments, hides and leather scraps near its former factory. At House Street in Belmont, many residential wells were polluted by PFAS emanating from historical landfills used by Wolverine to dispose of its PFAS-laden sludges. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the company would work with the EPA to place impermeable caps over five affected areas, and would conduct a  study to determine what additional remedial actions are appropriate. A sign posted on a fence around the former House Street landfill in Belmont warning of environmental contamination research is seen on Monday, March 11, 2019, where Wolverine Worldwide dumped their PFAS-containing waste for decades. “All parties have been working on this complicated settlement for a long time, and we appreciate the patience of residents who have been waiting more than two years for a resolution," Plainfield Township Manager Cameron Van Wyngarden and Algoma Township Supervisor Kevin Green said in a joint statement. “Plainfield has already invested in developing plans for water main extensions and, assuming the settlement is finalized, will be ready to bid the projects after the first of the year so we can begin construction in 2020. We will be addressing priority areas first for those who have been most impacted in both townships. “We also appreciate being able to reach a solution without having to go to trial, which will save taxpayers the time, and the uncertainties and expense of litigation.” A worker from GZA GeoEnvironmental, contracted by Wolverine World Wide collects residential well water samples in Rockford, March 1, 2019. Clean, safe drinking water for all Michigan residents is a priority of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration and EGLE, agency director Liesl Clark said. "The strong partnership we have forged with the State Attorney General's Office will help us achieve fair and equitable solutions for communities impacted by PFAS contamination," she said. The tentative agreement is being formalized into a consent decree that the parties expect to complete by the end of the year. The deal must then be approved by U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff, which would resolve the pending litigation between the state and two townships and Wolverine Worldwide. <em>Contact Keith Matheny: (313) 222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

 Kalamazoo River in Parchment, Wednesday, Feb. 6, 2019. TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — One of the companies responsible for polluting an 80-mile stretch of river and floodplains in southwestern Michigan with toxic chemicals will pay at least $245.2 million to advance a cleanup effort that began more than 20 years ago, federal officials said Wednesday. NCR Corp. will fund the dredging of contaminated sediments and removal of an aging dam in the Kalamazoo River under an agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Justice and the state of Michigan, officials told The Associated Press ahead of an official announcement. “This is a big step forward toward cleaning up the river," said John Irving, a deputy assistant administrator in the EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. The Kalamazoo is polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, from paper recycling mills. Used for ink removal, the chemicals were discharged into the river from the 1950s through the mid-1970s. They also seeped into groundwater and surface waters from landfills where mill waste was dumped. In addition to the river, the contamination zone in Allegan and Kalamazoo counties includes a roughly 3-mile section of a tributary called Portage Creek, as well as mill properties, riverbanks and floodplains. It is on the federal Superfund list of hazardous sites. Signs posted along the river warn anglers not to eat the fish they catch. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong > Read more:</strong></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/2019/12/11/west-ottawa-high-school-student-killed-bus-stop/4399496002/" target="_blank">Teen killed while walking to bus stop in West Michigan</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/2019/12/11/battle-creek-econo-lodge-fire-nuisance-motel/4394895002/" target="_blank">Battle Creek Econo Lodge burns the day it closes</a></span> The EPA has overseen the removal of nearly 450,000 cubic yards of soil and sediment from the area since 1998, in addition to cleaning up 7 miles of the river and riverbanks. Eighty-two acres of landfills containing PCBs have been covered with layers of clay, topsoil and vegetation to prevent the toxins from leaching into groundwater. But much remains to be done. The agreement between NCR and the government calls for the company to pay at least $135.7 million for cleanup work that is expected to take an additional 10-15 years. Among the tasks: dismantling Trowbridge Dam in Allegan County. The dam, which was built in 1898 to supply electric power to Kalamazoo, is in poor shape and has been over-topped by high water. It is the highest-priority dam removal planned in Michigan, according to the state Department of Natural Resources, which set aside $2.9 million in May to get the project underway. The first step is to stabilize the structure so that it won't collapse while a contractor dredges PCB-laced sediments from a 2.4-mile river section upstream, which is expected to take three years, said Paul Ruesch, the EPA's on-site coordinator. NCR funds will pay for that work and for razing the dam when the sediment removal is complete, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark told the AP. “You want to get that sediment out before taking the dam out, so you're not letting the sediments wash further downstream,” he said. The removal of tainted soils in several floodplain spots is also funded under the deal. And the company will also pay $76.5 million to the EPA to cover past and future costs of the river cleanup; $27 million to other federal and state agencies for damages to natural resources; and $6 million to the state for past and future costs. The proposed settlement was filed in federal court Wednesday. The public will get 30 days to comment, after which the government agencies could make revisions before requesting final court approval. NCR spokesman Scott Sykes said the company had no comment. The agreement represents a significant milestone in the overall cleanup, which is expected to end up costing about $851 million, Clark said. Payment negotiations are continuing with other companies that share responsibility for the pollution, including Georgia-Pacific, International Paper and Weyerhaeuser. The Kalamazoo River project is among those on the Superfund list designated by the Trump administration for special attention because of cleanup delays, Irving said. “This settlement represents substantial progress in the cleanup and restoration of the Kalamazoo River,” said Liesl Clark, Director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. In addition to protecting public health and the environment, she said, it will fund "projects to restore natural resources and help compensate the public for lost recreational opportunities within this important Southwest Michigan watershed.”

They oppose the US Ecology hazardous waste facility that is a few blocks from their homes.</span><meta content= "" itemprop="copyrightHolder"/><span class="credit">(Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press)</span></span> A hazardous waste processing facility in Detroit — which could gain state approval to expand its storage facilities tenfold — has released excessive amounts of mercury, arsenic, cyanide and other toxic chemicals into the city sewer system more than 150 times since September 2010, a review of Great Lakes Water Authority records shows. US Ecology is allowed to put pretreated chemical waste into the sewer system, but under strict, permitted requirements. The Free Press, through the Michigan Freedom of Information Act, reviewed records related to the company's wastewater discharge permit going back to September 2010. The records are held by the Great Lakes Water Authority, the regional body that took over wastewater treatment operations from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department on Jan. 1. <strong>► Related: </strong> The records show frequent, sometimes alarming, violations of permitted maximum discharges on at least 20 hazardous chemicals or metals, either discovered by the authority during inspections or self-reported by US Ecology at its facility on Georgia Street near the Hamtramck border. The records also show that the company almost never provided a written explanation to Water Authority officials about why a violation occurred and why it wouldn't again in the future, a requirement of its permit. US Ecology officials issued an e-mailed statement in response to Free Press requests for an interview. They stated the excessive discharges were infrequent — found in less than 1% of the more than 10,000 tests conducted over four years. "While our goal is to eliminate all discharge exceedances, the ones that do occur tend to be very minor in nature and their frequency is low relative to the thousands of monitoring tests conducted annually," US Ecology spokesman David Crumrine said in the written statement. <strong>►DEQ: </strong> State and local regulators say the releases never threatened human health or the environment, never interfered with the wastewater treatment plant's processes, and didn't end up causing excessively toxic flows out of the plant and into the Detroit or Rouge rivers. But environmental experts point to the potential cumulative environmental damage from even tiny amounts of some toxins not adequately controlled at times at the hazardous waste facility. And officials with another large Midwest city's sewer system — Milwaukee —  say the number of permit violations at US Ecology raises red flags. "We view anything over four or five exceedances" in a year "as bad news," said Bill Graffin, spokesman for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District. "The number, 150, you have there is way extreme from what we might see," added Sharon Mertens, director of water quality protection at Milwaukee's sewer district and head of its industrial wastewater pretreatment program. While Milwaukee's sewer system does not serve any hazardous waste processing facility, it does accept chemical waste-treaters' discharges, Mertens said. It also has a "very large, diverse industrial base," Graffin said. At the center of the Detroit controversy are local residents, already wary of the hazardous waste facility's proximity to their homes, schools, churches and playgrounds. They see US Ecology's violations as a sign the company can't fully control the industrial wastes already being moved through it. That bolsters their adamant stance that the facility shouldn't be allowed to expand by a DEQ that — particularly after the Flint water crisis — they don't trust to prioritize their well-being over economic interests. "I'm horrified. This is not acceptable," said Diane Weckerle, who's part of a coalition of area residents opposed to the facility's expansion. "It makes me furious," said Sharon Buttry, who lives in nearby Hamtramck. Mark Covington has lived only about a mile from the facility all of this life. "Even as an adult, I didn't actually know what they did there," he said. "People around here definitely don't know they are allowed to dump a certain amount in the sewer system." The US Ecology facility, at 6520 Georgia St., takes in many of the region's most toxic chemicals from industrial processes, as well as very low-level radioactive byproducts primarily from oil and gas hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Located near the Hamtramck-Detroit border on the east side, the facility is within a mile-and-a-half of a public playground, Dickinson East Elementary School, Oakland International Academy charter school, several churches and scores of residential homes. Records show that US Ecology had wastewater discharge violations in eight to 10 months of every year from 2011 through 2015. While most of the more than 150 violations involved violating daily limits, at least 23 violations involved excessive averages of specific toxic chemicals over an entire month. Wastewater sampling occurs from under a manhole cover just outside US Ecology's facility, which is upstream of the public sewer, ensuring that the company's discharges are isolated for inspection. The sampling results, at times, have been startling: Despite some of the high numbers, Stephen  Kuplicki, an industrial waste control manager with the Great Lakes Water Authority, concurred generally with US Ecology's position. "Because the facility is so vigorously monitored, there are large numbers of samples taken and thousands of parameters that are tested for," he said. "This can lead to what looks like a large number of exceedances simply due to the large volume of samples." The wastewater treatment plant itself must comply with federal environmental guidelines with its discharge, and US Ecology's violations have never led to a plant violation, or interfered with treatment processes, he pointed out. "The plant is able to treat US Ecology's discharge and ensure the protection of the environment," he said. It's more important that certain discharged materials from US Ecology don't consistently exceed regulatory limits, Kuplicki said. "Through our stringent monitoring, we have been able to determine that no such patterns currently exist, and US Ecology has always been able to demonstrate compliance within 30 days of their written notice through verified sampling," he said. Indeed, the records show time after time, after receiving a notice of violation, US Ecology officials remedied it by presenting their own, later sampling, conducted by a contracted laboratory, that showed the toxic chemical or metal no longer exceeded permitted maximums. But compliance has often been short-lived. Records show 37 violations of titanium discharge levels from March 2011 to September 2015. After each violation — even when it was determined to be in "significant noncompliance" for titanium in 2013 — US Ecology was subsequently deemed back in compliance because it submitted new sampling showing a titanium level within permitted parameters — until the next violation, one to three months later. "It's a mess," said Nicholas Schroeck, director of the Transnational Environmental Law Clinic at Wayne State University Law School. "The question is, when you have a repeated lack of compliance, over and over again, are they ever actually in compliance?" Among the requirements US Ecology faces is controlling the alkalinity of its wastewater. Regulations require pH levels lower than 11.5 units. (A pH level of 7.0 is neutral, with a smaller number more acidic and a higher number more alkaline.) In an April 1 letter this year from Water Authority Interim Director David McNeely to US Ecology officials, he announced changes to the company's wastewater discharge permit to require continuous pH monitoring, after the findings from two straight months of monitoring from Oct. 7 to Dec. 6, 2015. "There were 322 instances of pH noncompliance greater than 11.5 units," McNeely stated, adding that US Ecology staff failed to self-report any exceedances to either Detroit Water and Sewerage Department or Great Lakes Water Authority staff. "It is obvious that US Ecology exercises limited control of the pH of its discharge," McNeely stated. A 2013 University of Maryland study showed acid rain and human pollution are making rivers more alkaline in the eastern U.S. "It's like rivers on Rolaids," associate geology professor and study lead author Sujay Kaushal said in a 2013 release. "We have some natural antacid in watersheds. In headwater streams, that can be a good thing. But we're also seeing antacid compounds increasing downriver. And those sites are not acidic, and algae and fish can be sensitive to alkalinity changes." More alkaline waterways can mean more algae blooms and harder, more saline water, decreasing its drinkability and the difficulty in treating it. Hazardous waste processing facilities are a very difficult type of industry to regulate because of the diverse materials they collect and treat, said Jodi Peace, the DEQ's industrial pretreatment specialist. "Centralized waste-treaters in general have some of the worst compliance records of any type of industry that discharges into wastewater treatment plants," she said. In the Great Lakes Water Authority's annual report to the DEQ for 2015, four other centralized waste-treaters in addition to US Ecology received at least one notice of exceedance. US Ecology's compliance is actually better now than in years past, Peace said. "I've been looking at it since the mid-1990s, when it was really bad," she said. "There would be many more violations, a lot of oil. There were a number of centralized waste-treaters back then who were in significant violation all the time." The purpose of the industrial pretreatment program is to protect the sewer system from industrial wastes that might harm pipelines or infrastructure at the wastewater treatment plant, or that might interfere with the plant's processes, such as a chemical that kills off the bacteria used to eat organic wastes. The maximum levels of toxic chemicals in industrial wastewater discharges are set under federal law so industries can't shop from state-to-state for more lenient standards, Peace said. They are set not only taking into consideration human health and environmental protection, but the type of industry and the wastes it produces, and the latest technologies available to reduce pollutants. Ensuring US Ecology complies with its discharge permit falls to the Great Lakes Water Authority. But the DEQ has inspected the US Ecology facility multiple times since September 2010, and found it in compliance with environmental law and regulations — even as discharge violations were popping up. Violations that aren't chronic and recurring are "more of a naggy kind of little thing," Peace said. If it is not a significant noncompliance, "it's more of the routine, 'Show us you are back in compliance.'" And any exceedances are not passing a cost onto Detroit sewer ratepayers, Kuplicki said. "The discharge does not affect the treatment costs at the plant," he said. Wastes that are difficult for bacteria to break down, such as suspended solids, are what adds significant cost to wastewater treatment, Peace said. Industries like US Ecology pay a surcharge for the volumes of excess solids they introduce to the system, she said. Great Lakes Water Authority officials declined to provide the Free Press with records indicating how much US Ecology pays for sewer service. The biosolids left after clarification — settling tanks at wastewater treatment plants that remove solids — have water further removed and are then incinerated, taken to landfills or processed into fertilizer that is spread on area farms, Peace said. Those biosolids are tested for metals and other pollutants per U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines, Peace said, and have not been found in violation. The sheer volumes of wastewater moving into the Detroit sewer system — the largest single-site wastewater treatment plant in the U.S., and one of the biggest systems that combines sewage and stormwater drainage — may help explain why excessive levels in US Ecology's discharge don't amount to much upon reaching the plant. "If you look at the size of the Detroit wastewater treatment plant, it would take an awful lot of anything to cause a problem — not that we're in favor of, 'Dilution is the solution,'" Peace said. That's not good enough for Wayne State's Schroeck. "When US Ecology is violating these pretreatment requirements, it shows symptoms of a larger problem that they can't, for whatever reason, stay within their permit parameters that are there to make sure our waters remain usable, fishable, swimmable places to be," he said. "If they can't handle it now, how are they supposed to handle it when the facility has expanded 10 times in size?" A frequent violator of pretreatment requirements is "super-unfair to the taxpayers," whether or not those violations are leading to water quality problems at the wastewater treatment plant or in its discharge, Mertens at the Milwaukee wastewater treatment plant said. In addition to any treatment costs, some chemical and metal discharges, in excess, can rapidly corrode sewer infrastructure, she said. "There's all kinds of issues that have a cumulative effect," Mertens said. "Under federal law, dilution is not the solution to pollution." The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department conducted a visual inspection of sewer pipes outside US Ecology after a 2013 incident in which a mysterious foam rose up from a drainage basin near the facility. The foam was washed back down the drain  by responding Detroit firefighters using hoses and wasn't analyzed, Peace said. The city's pipe inspection "identified large calcium deposits" under several manholes near US Ecology, she said. Mercury overages are particularly troublesome, said Joel Blum, a University of Michigan professor of Earth and environmental sciences. "Mercury is a toxin with unusual properties that make it a cause for concern even though the levels at the wastewater treatment plant may not be over the regulatory limits," he said. Because mercury isn't broken down in wastewater treatment processes, it could end up in small amounts in the Detroit and Rouge rivers via discharge, or in the atmosphere as a gas after dried sludge incineration that then settles on land and water, Blum said. The metal then "bioaccumulates" in the food web with every creature that takes it in — a tiny aquatic insect eats the mercury, gets eaten by a small fish, which gets eaten by a medium-sized fish, which gets eaten by a larger fish, magnifying the contamination the larger and more complex the fish or animal gets. Larger fish can see an increase in mercury concentration up to a million times higher than the concentration in water, Blum said. "Thus, it is not only the concentration of mercury released to waterways and the atmosphere that is important, but the total amount of mercury, even if it is present at low concentrations," he said. Such chemicals and metals, Mertens said, "don't just disappear. " They have to be dealt with, one way or another. "I think it's especially disturbing that a company that makes its business out of that whole concept — that you have to treat waste — is passing it along," she said. "That's just not a good thing." More needs to be done to force consistent compliance with US Ecology, said David Holtz, chairman of the nonprofit environmental group Sierra Club's Michigan Chapter. "This sends a message to polluters that violating environmental rules and dumping hazardous wastes is no big deal if it happens in low-income, minority neighborhoods in Detroit," he said. "DEQ Director Heidi Grether needs to deal with this and do so immediately. People want and deserve an environmental cop on the beat, not one that enables corporate polluters and doesn’t even let families in on the reality of what’s going on in their own neighborhood." The DEQ in July 2015 announced its intention to approve a new license for US Ecology that would allow it to increase hazardous waste storage in tanks and containers from 64,000 gallons to nearly 666,000 gallons. The public outcry was large, with demonstrations held outside the plant by opposed area residents. Richard Conforti, the DEQ's permit engineer for the facility, said US Ecology did not ask for an expansion of its wastewater discharges, only its storage capacity. The company's permit with the Great Lakes Water Authority limits hazardous waste liquid discharges at a maximum of 144,000 gallons per day, with an overall wastewater discharge limit of 300,000 gallons per day. "They would have to get that changed first before they could discharge more," Conforti said. Crumrine, the US Ecology spokesman, said there will be no increased discharges to the sewer system associated with the storage capacity increase. Even if such a sewer discharge increase was later allowed, the wastewater would still need to comply with permitted limits on hazardous chemical levels, Conforti said. After a delay to respond to hundreds of public comments, the DEQ is continuing to consider approving the permit to allow US Ecology to expand its storage, he said. Mosetta Jackson, 81, lives on Concord Street, about a half-block from the US Ecology facility, and has lived in the community for more than 60 years, raising seven daughters there. She lives across from a public playground. She opposes the proposed US Ecology expansion, but doesn't expect the DEQ will listen to her and others. "We're ignored because we're a poor, black neighborhood," she said. "We're worried about what it's going to mean to our health." <em>Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

 Aaron Filipski, Royal Oak's Director of Public Services shows residents how to test lead pipes at home. In the latest release of test results for lead-contaminated water, Detroit’s water users got refreshing news: the stuff flowing from taps in Detroit passed the new standard imposed by the state of Michigan, considered strictest in the nation. “The Detroit Water and Sewerage Department reports the city’s total water sampling results are under the Lead and Copper Rule action level,” said a statement issued Tuesday by DWSD. While the city’s latest test results show slightly higher lead levels than in the past, the higher levels “are due to a change in state regulated testing methods,” Gary Brown, director of DWSD, said in the media statement. Gary Brown, director of the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department. The finding that Detroit passed may surprise some water users, after Each of those communities buys its water from what had been Detroit’s system but now is regionally controlled, in a consortium called the Great Lakes Water Authority. Across metro Detroit, water users on the regional system should know that “the water leaving Detroit’s water treatment plants, operated by the Great Lakes Water Authority, does not contain lead,” Brown said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/11/14/lead-water-michigan-filter-test-pipes-quarter-magnet/2542088001/" target="_blank">Lead in your home's water? 2 items around your house could help you find out</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/10/07/birmingham-issues-lead-advisory-after-testing/3901964002/" target="_blank">Birmingham, White Lake Twp. issue advisories after water testing shows some homes exceed lead standards</a></span> Instead, the sources of lead contamination in water are the lead service lines that may bring water into old homes, as well as old-style lead-based solder used to connect copper plumbing, and plumbing fixtures such as faucets that may have internal lead components. According to the state’s new standard, a community water supply calls for special interventions — including the free distribution of water filters to pregnant women and homes with children under age 18 — if more than 10% of all water samples from that community exceed the "action level" for lead of 15 parts per billion, or ppb. Detroit has been aggressive for years about replacing the city’s many lead water-service lines at no cost to homeowners, DWSD officials said. Even before the state of Michigan enacted the most stringent Lead and Copper Rule in the nation, DWSD began replacing lead service lines during water main replacement projects and providing pitcher filters to those residents and businesses as a precautionary measure, said DWSD spokeman Bryan Peckinpaugh. "We've replaced more than 500 lead service lines just in the last year,” Peckinpaugh said. Elsewhere, communities such as Birmingham have just begun discussing how they will fund the replacements, which Birmingham City Manager Joe Valentine says cost $5,000 to $10,000 per house. Detroit’s latest test results stem from samples collected last summer from 55 homes that have lead service lines. Of those, 54 of the homes had test results well below the action level of 15 ppb. The overall range of Detroit’s test results placed the 90th percentile of Detroit’s 55 samples at 10 ppb, which was well under the action level of 15 ppb, the DWSD statement said. One home did test above the state’s “action level” of 15 ppb, DWSD said. That home had a very high result of 114 ppb in a sample collected from the first few seconds of water running from the kitchen tap, after the water sat in the home's plumbing for more than six hours, as required in the state tests. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2019/11/05/saint-clair-shores-water-high-lead-levels/4163577002/" target="_blank">Another Michigan city tests high for lead levels. This time it's St. Clair Shores</a></span> Yet, after technicians let the water run for several minutes in the problem home, allowing them to capture a sample once they’d flushed away 4 liters — slightly more than 4 quarts — the same home’s water passed the state's test with 6 ppb, DWSD said. They notified the homeowner of the results, explained how to run the kitchen faucet for several minutes to flush away contaminated water, provided a free filter-pitcher with replacement cartridges and had DWSD staff check the home’s plumbing to see what might need replacement, such as an aging kitchen faucet that might contain lead parts, DWSD's statement said. Another lesson for that homeowner was learning to remove a small circular screen inside the faucet’s end, called the aerator. That screen can collect lead particles and cause water that sits for long periods inside the faucet to become contaminated. The fix? Cleaning the screen by scrubbing it with vinegar and an old toothbrush. "But don't use that toothbrush to brush your teeth," said Scott Dean, spokesman for the Michigan Department of the Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. Across Michigan, the main reason that more homes are showing up as exceeding 15 ppb in this year’s round of testing is that a new procedure for sampling is required by the state, Dean said. But the state's ultimate goal for Michiganders is "zero lead exposure," Dean said. In this Thursday, May 17, 2018 photo, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha was interviewed in Flint. She was the pediatrician and public health expert said to be first to reveal the extent of lead contamination on the struggling city’s children. The greatest impact of lead poisoning is on pregnant mothers and formula-fed infants, said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who wrote "What the Eyes Don't See," about how she helped uncover the lead crisis in Flint's water supply. Besides increases in fetal death and reduced birth weights, Hanna-Attisha said in her book that about 25% of infants showed dangerous levels of lead in their blood even after drinking formula made of tap water that contained just 10 ppb of lead, which is below Michigan's "action level" of 15 ppb. Lead poisoning in a growing child can cause a lifetime lower IQ, learning disabilities and numerous other health problems. The new chief public health officer for Detroit, Denise Fair, said she was pleased that the latest test results for water kept the city under the state’s action level. But that shouldn’t justify complacency about the threat of lead poisoning in Detroit, Fair warned. “We know that the presence of lead in decaying paint and dust is the No. 1  source of lead poisoning in children living in homes that were built before 1978,” Fair said, in the DWSD media statement. Any city resident worried that a child has been exposed to lead should request a lead test from the child’s doctor or contact the Detroit Health Department at 313-876-0133. <em>Contact Bill Laitner: blaitner@freepress.com</em>

 An aerial video of the Detroit property contaminated with uranium and other dangerous chemicals partially collapsed into the Detroit River. You may know Revere Copper and Brass for cookware and its roots in the era of the American Revolution. But you may not know the company — which made headlines this week as the former owner of a uranium-tainted storage site in southwest Detroit that partially collapsed into the Detroit River — played a major role in World War II as it was subcontracted in the 1940s to build the world’s first atomic bomb. People survey the scene of a Detroit property contaminated with uranium and other dangerous chemicals that partially collapsed into the Detroit River on Friday, December 6, 2019. Here is a history of how the company and others in the Detroit area got into the war effort: Revere Copper was founded by patriot Paul Revere in 1801 after he began a copper foundry following the Revolutionary War. More than 100 years later, the company was going strong into the 20th Century. In 1929, the name changed to Revere Copper and Brass, and it began focusing its efforts on cookware. Revere Ware pots, pans and skillets were released to the public in 1939, becoming an immediate success. In the early 1940s, civilian production was halted by World War II, as items such as smoke bombs and cartridges and rocket cases were needed for the war. The Revere Copper plant in Detroit The K-732 switchyard was built in 1944 to help power Manhattan Project-era uranium enrichment facilities at the old Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant made uranium rods under contracts with the Atomic Energy Commission, as well as beryllium ingots, alloys and billets. In the early 1960s, Revere Copper created a thorium bar, which was divided and sent to other AEC plants. <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://windsorstar.com/news/local-news/investigations-called-for-on-both-sides-of-border-following-detroit-river-incident" target="_blank">According to the Windsor Star, </a> However, a 2011 evaluation of the property by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health said there was a “potential ... for significant residual radiation.” On the cookware side, the company went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1982, and was later sold to Corning Glass and then World Kitchen. Today, the company remains under Cooking World and continues to sell cookware. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/12/05/detroit-bulk-storage-revere-copper-detroit-river-uranium/2618868001/" target="_blank">Uranium-contaminated site collapses into Detroit River</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/12/06/uranium-detroit-river-bulk-storage-water/4351792002/" target="_blank">Uranium in Detroit River: 7 things to know after partial collapse at Detroit Bulk Storage</a></span> In addition to Revere Copper's involvement in making atomic bombs, other companies across metro Detroit were connected to the Manhattan Project. Parts for the Little Boy atomic bomb, which was dropped on Hiroshima, were The mushroom cloud from the "Little Boy" bomb. Roger Meade, a retired archivist for Los Alamos National Laboratory, told WDET-FM (101.9) in 2016 that Detroit was an ideal site for the Manhattan Project because "it was a huge labor pool for skilled labor, particularly machinists and draftsman … and some of it was just the capacity to work on large pieces of steel.” Meade also said Michigan played a role in manufacturing Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. Greg Sumner, a professor of history at the University of Detroit Mercy, told WDET that as the Motor City, Detroit was quickly able to turn to war production. However, manufacturers relegated to the Manhattan Project did not know what they were working on, as everything had to be kept a secret. The secretive nature was also protocoled at a Engineers assembled diffusers, or cylindrical metal containers, that were sent to the Army's Oak Ridge atomic plant in Tennessee. By the following year, thousands of people were working at Chrysler's Lynch Road factory building diffusers that were used to create Little Boy. By the end of the war, the company had delivered more than 3,500 diffusers to Tennessee, with the factory staying open until the 1980s.

 Macomb County public works and fire crews worked to contain and find the cause of an apparent petroleum leak in a relief drain in Warren on Friday, Jan. 3, 2020. A day after Macomb County public works and fire crews discovered petroleum flowing into the Clinton River, the source of the oil spill remained a mystery. The search for the source came up inconclusive Saturday, according to the Macomb County Public Works Office. The investigation began Friday morning when a resident along the Clinton River near Budd Park in Clinton Township, which is roughly at 17 Mile and Clinton River Road, Public works and fire crews from Clinton Township, Sterling Heights and Warren tracked the source back to the relief drain, which travels south-north under Schoenherr from 9 Mile Road to just north of 14 Mile Road. However, they were unable to pinpoint an exact source, estimating that the spill ended before crews could find it. The Macomb County Public Works Office places containment booms at the confluence of the Schoenherr Relief Drain and the Red Run Drain, at nearly 14 Mile and Schoenherr roads, in Sterling Heights on Jan. 3, 2020 to contain a large amount of petroleum that spilled into the drain. An investigation is underway to determine the source of the petroleum. The public works office said it is believed that between 75 and 100 gallons of petroleum product entered the drain. Containment booms are in place where the Schoenherr Relief Drain in Warren empties into the Red Run Drain, located north of 14 Mile Road in Sterling Heights. The Red Run then enters the Clinton River near Freedom Hill Country park, also in Sterling Heights. Investigators made several entries into the underground drain in Warren on Saturday and will continue to investigate. Absorbent booms, which collect the petroleum, will stay in place until the water is clean again. "This incident shows how all of our storm water drains are part of one larger system," said Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller. "Here's a spill that happened in Warren and was seen in the river some 5 or 10 miles away on the way out to Lake St. Clair. We appreciate the responsible citizens who alert us to these incidents. We continue to be vigilant and make inspections of our drains, but we also rely on our good neighbors for assistance in sounding the alarm when there is a problem. I also appreciate the work of the staffs at Clinton Township, Warren and Sterling Heights, who assisted with this response. "And make no mistake, if we do find the responsible party for this spill, we will be seeking to recoup the costs and take other actions as appropriate." <em> Staff writer Christina Hall contributed to this report. </em> <i>Contact Micah Walker: mwalker1@freepress.com.

 Macomb County public works and fire crews worked to contain and find the cause of an apparent petroleum leak in a relief drain in Warren on Friday, Jan. 3, 2020. Macomb County public works and fire crews worked Friday to contain and find the cause of an apparent petroleum leak in a relief drain in Warren. The Schoenherr Relief Drain near 14 Mile and Schoenherr is a large underground storm drain that enters the Red Run Drain. The Red Run Drain enters the Clinton River and eventually Lake St. Clair, public works said in a release. A resident along the Clinton River near Budd Park in Clinton Township, which is roughly at 17 Mile and Clinton River Road, noticed a sheen moving down the river in the morning. Public works and fire crews from Clinton Township, Sterling Heights and Warren tracked the source back to the relief drain, which travels south-north under Schoenherr from 9 Mile Road to just north of 14 Mile Road, according to the release. Public works personnel believe the petroleum in the drain came from a fuel storage tank of some kind, based on the volume of material in the drain. Dan Heaton, communications manager for public works, said Friday night that officials don't know the volume of material. But, it stated in the office's release it was a large amount. The Macomb County Public Works Office places containment booms at the confluence of the Schoenherr Relief Drain and the Red Run Drain, at nearly 14 Mile and Schoenherr roads, in Sterling Heights on Jan. 3, 2020 to contain a large amount of petroleum that spilled into the drain. An investigation is underway to determine the source of the petroleum. The material has been contained at roughly 14 Mile and Schoenherr, he said. Public works released photos showing crews placing containment booms at the confluence of the relief drain and the Red Run near 14 Mile and Schoenherr in Sterling Heights. Heaton said this leak has no connection to the "green ooze" of industrial pollution first spotted two week ago along I-696 in Madison Heights in Oakland County that came from a former metal-plating factory. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2020/01/03/suburban-detroit-epa-checks-green-slime-dirt-next-696/2799209001/" target="_blank">EPA checks dirt at 'green slime' site for pollution beside I-696 in Madison Heights</a></span> The Macomb County Public Works Office places containment booms at the confluence of the Schoenherr Relief Drain and the Red Run Drain, at nearly 14 Mile and Schoenherr roads, in Sterling Heights on Jan. 3, 2020 to contain a large amount of petroleum that spilled into the drain.

Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said thanks to the citizen, the flow in the drain and the river spotted Friday was caught "before the bulk of it made it to Lake St. Clair." "We are all one big watershed and all the storm water in the metro area runs out to Lake St. Clair or other parts of the Great Lakes Basin. We all have to work together to prevent pollution from entering the lakes," she said. Inspectors from county public works and Warren were working Friday afternoon to try to pinpoint the source of where the fuel entered the drain.

 Joe Henninger of Harrison Twp. witnessed brown sewage-like debris washing up on his Lake St. Clair beach front after heavy rains hit recently. It's a stinky, nasty-looking, frozen mixture of green and black sludge and has something stringy in it that looks like it could be hair or algae. It sits bunched up in a long, 2- to 3-foot-high pile along the seawall at Joe Henninger's house, which backs up to Lake St. Clair in Harrison Township. Henninger watched Tuesday as Sam Madden, an environmentalist with the Macomb County Health Department, took samples of the mystery substance that has  been found in large and small amounts up and down the Lake St. Clair shoreline this week. It showed up days after a nearly billion-gallon release of combined sewage overflows into the lake during heavy rains. "It does stink," Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller said, as she watched Madden take the samples for E. coli testing. If there is E. coli, further testing to determine whether it's human or animal are expected, county officials said. "It's really kinda a funkiness all down the coast," Henninger said. "If it gets into the drinking water, that's a real problem." Harrison Twp. resident Joe Henninger noticed waves of sludge splashing up onto his break wall last week after heavy rains hit the metro Detroit area. The Macomb County health department took samples Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2020 to test the contents of the material. But what is the murky, sludgy looking stuff that has landed in residents' yards and on seawalls and where did it come from? Henninger saw the substance being carried to shore in waves Saturday morning and shot a video from his backyard at his home along Jefferson, south of Shook Road, which was then posted on the Save Lake St. Clair Facebook page. Henninger, who has lived in his home since 2016, said he saw a black band in the water that looked like feces and a white band that looked like toilet paper. "It's just really disgusting. We're pumping it into our own drinking water," he said.

The Save Lake St. Clair Facebook page said the Warren Wastewater Treatment Plant released nearly 40 million gallons of sanitary sewer overflow into the Red Run Drain between Jan. 11 and Jan. 13, which eventually flows into the lake. But until test results come back, possibly by Thursday afternoon, it's anyone's guess what the substance is. Macomb County Health Department environmentalist RS Sam Madden collects samples along the Lake St. Clair shoreline Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2020 at Harrison Twp. resident Joe Henninger's home after waves of sludge splashed up onto his break wall last week after heavy rains hit the metro Detroit area. Andrew Cox, environmental health director for Macomb County, said he didn't think the situation presents a health emergency, but said "it's a concern." He said if the material is E. coli, officials would work to collect the material and dispose of it at their cost. If the material is natural from the lake, he said, homeowners would probably be responsible for the cost of cleaning it up from their properties. Oakland County Water Resources Commissioner Jim Nash said the released water from Oakland County was treated and screened and "we're producing the safest water we can under that permit." He said the combined sewer overflow couldn't have contributed to what residents in Macomb County saw this past weekend. Nash said it's his understanding, from experts he talked with, that the material is lake turnover — vegetation that dies off, starts rotting and floats and during a normal winter isn't seen because of ice on the water. Nash said there may be some animal and human DNA in the material. "Lake St. Clair is the highest it's ever been in 100 years or more. People see it in their yards where they never saw it before," he said. "This has nothing to do with any sewage releases. It's really how a lake works. ... That's my understanding." Macomb County's Miller doesn't know what the substance is, but said officials have got to work to eliminate any contamination getting into the lake. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2020/01/04/petroleum-leak-warren-drain-sheen-found-moving-down-clinton-river/2809499001/" target="_blank">Crews containing petroleum leak in Warren drain ; sheen found moving down Clinton River</a></span> She pointed to the city of Warren, which is spending $52 million to build a detention basin.

Michael Gutow, founder of the Save Lake St. Clair Facebook page, said adding detention basins or capacity is better than nothing, but during massive rainstorms there will still be combined sewer overflows. To truly fix the problem, he said, officials need to separate the storm water and sanitary sewers in the older communities where they are not separated. But that very expensive. For example, Miller said that for Eastpointe and 20% of St. Clair Shores to separate its underground systems, it would cost $350 million. She's trying to make improvements to the flows coming from these two areas by expanding capacity at the Chapaton basin, which is a $30 million project.

A grayish hairy substance can be seen stuck on snow and ice along the Lake St. Clair shoreline. The Macomb County health department took samples Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2020 to test the contents of the material. Gutow, of St. Clair Shores, said he'll be the first to admit that what residents are seeing along the shoreline this week is not all sewage. He believes there is normal lake debris and algae, too, "however, there is human waste mixed in there as well." "It's a whole mixture — one big soup pot of all that stuff comin' in there," he said. Gutow said he believes it's not up to the homeowners to be responsible for cleaning this up — it's up to the counties that are discharging. Gutow said he would like the public to be alerted when the area is expected to receive 1 inch or more of rain so residents can limit water usage to prevent sewage getting into the lake or backing up into basements. Doug Martz, who was chairman of Macomb County's former water quality board, also said that separating the underground systems is what is needed. Martz, who has been fighting pollution for more than two decades, said he thinks the material is a combination of what was released from the communities and sediment in the bottom of the Clinton River spillway and the lake.

 Joe Henninger of Harrison Twp. witnessed brown sewage-like debris washing up on his Lake St. Clair beach front after heavy rains hit recently. Tests results from samples of sludgy material that rolled onto the Lake St. Clair shoreline indicate it is "decaying filamentous algae with E. coli counts that present no imminent public health hazard" and that it is not indicative of raw sewage. That was the word late Thursday from the Macomb County Health Department after laboratory and visual analysis of the greenish-blackish stringy material. The Health Department collected samples Tuesday after the mysterious substance was found in large and small amounts along the shoreline this week — days after a nearly billion-gallon release of combined sewage and sanitary sewer overflows into the lake after heavy rain earlier this month. It took samples from behind Joe Henninger's house, where the material is bunched up in a 2- to 3-foot high pile along the seawall, which is along the lake in Harrison Township.

 The state says there is no immediate health threat as crews continue to clean up a The underground plume is not impacting air quality or the drinking water, Jill Greenberg, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), said Sunday. The contaminated water is migrating underground and working its way to the freeway, she said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is working with the state , determined the liquid likely was groundwater contaminated with hexavalent chromium. Samples results from the site are expected this week, Greenberg said. The spill has been traced to a nearby, closed electro-plating company in Madison Heights whose owner was convicted of illegally storing dangerous chemicals in leaky containers. "We are operating under the presumption that this is groundwater contaminated with chromium from historic plating operations,"  Greenberg said in a statement. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/21/green-liquid-i-696-lane-closed/2721790001/" target="_blank">Mysterious greenish-yellow liquid gushing from walls on I-696 identified</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/11/06/madison-heights-chemical-firm-fined-1-4-m-owner-sent-prison/2509632001/" target="_blank">Madison Heights chemical firm fined $1.45M, owner sent to prison</a></span> Hexavalent chromium is the same chemical Pacific Gas and Electric Company was accused of contaminating the drinking water with in a southern California town in the famous lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich. <u><strong> For more on Freep:</strong></u> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/12/22/woman-jumps-lyft-96/2726458001/ " target="_blank">Woman jumps out moving Lyft on I-96 in Detroit, Michigan State Police says</a> The ooze came from Electro-Plating Services at 945 E. 10 Mile, whose owner is After the state shut the facility down in 2016, the EPA spent nearly $1.5 million cleaning up the plant as part of a Superfund removal action.

 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. It was no merry splash of holiday color when a bright-green liquid gushed from a freeway wall onto I-696 during Friday’s rush hour in Madison Heights. The green gusher backed up thousands of motorists, requiring first a one-lane closure, then two lanes on eastbound I-696 just before Dequindre — likely to last at least through this week. Yet those were comparatively minor problems. Far more worrisome has been deciding what’s in this grinchy gift, how much area did it contaminate, and why wasn’t this gusher choked off last year when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spent $1.5 million cleaning up the source of the pollution. <strong> Do you have an Alexa device or Google assistant? <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/tech/2019/08/21/amazon-alexa-google-assistant-voice/2072566001/ " target="_blank">Here's how you can listen</a> to the Detroit Free Press news briefing every weekday morning</strong> According to a state of Michigan official at the site Monday, last year’s clean-up removed the “imminent threat” to health and safety. But investigators didn’t figure on the basement of the factory gradually becoming a hidden reservoir of contaminated liquid, growing with rain and groundwater to become a small geyser seeking an outlet. The source is a defunct metal-plating firm, sitting on the service drive above the freeway. Its owner must report to federal prison by mid-January after pleading guilty Nov. 6 to pollution violations. In the lengthy investigation that led to the arrest of Gary Sayers, state and federal officials declared that the factory Sayers inherited from his father was a Superfund site, and the clean-up took nearly a year. The building from which hexavalent chromium-contaminated groundwater leaked onto I-696. Photographed in Madison Heights, Monday, Dec. 23, 2019. While the liquid is now cleaned up, there is now an absorbent material at the base of the spill. Yet over the weekend, emergency crews pumped thousands of gallons of the sickly green liquid from beneath Sayers’ former factory. And then, environmental experts issued a dire early analysis: the green liquid likely was groundwater contaminated with highly toxic hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium-6. It’s the same chemical that a giant California utility let contaminate drinking water, according to a lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich, whose David-versus-Goliath battle became a movie in 2000 starring Julia Roberts. “You don’t want to touch it – you don’t want to go in that building,” said EPA investigator Tricia Edwards, at the site on Monday. She was one of dozens of state and federal workers who canceled holiday vacation plans to pounce on a site they thought was safe. Although the green gusher posed no immediate risk to the public, largely because no one for miles around gets water from a well, investigators said the return of obvious contamination at the site was a shocking disappointment. Sayers could not be reached Monday. He was at the site of his defunct business on Friday night, signing a release so that a pollution clean-up crew could enter his property, a state environmental spokeswoman said. Paul Tamm, who co-owns Tam-Kor Engineering across the street, said he'd known Sayers for years, considers him a friend and that "he's not a criminal -- he's just eccentric." But while patrons like Ray Frawely of Hazel Park at nearby Max Dugan's Bar were joking about naming a new drink “green slime,” state and federal pollution investigators were trying to assess how the spill had erupted. In the basement of the former Electro-Plating Services, “Gary Sayers hand dug a pit -- he told me himself,” recalled Tracy Kecskemeti, district coordinator in Southeast Michigan for the state’s newly renamed environmental agency – the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE). Kecskemeti interviewed Sayers as part of the state and federal investigations into his pollution violations. He was sentenced in November to a year in federal prison. The pit was roughly 10-by-10 feet and “five or six feet deep,” Kecskemeti said Monday. Its bottom? Just dirt. “And while he was operating there, for many years I believe, he had all of the liquid waste flowing into that pit. Every so often, he would pump out that pit into a tank, filter it and run it into the city sewers,” she said. During the EPA’s clean-up, the pit was fully emptied, as were every tank, vat, barrel and can of dangerous chemicals in the factory. Then clean-up contractors filled the pit with gravel to stabilize it. This photo provided by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality showed conditions in 2017 inside Electro-Plating Service on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights, which has since been cleaned up as an EPA Superfund site. But Kecskemeti now says it must have gradually filled with water, which leached into the pit from above the clay layer underground, and also likely flowed into the factory’s basement from rain coming through holes in the deteriorating roof. The water mixed with pollution residues embedded in the earth around the pit, turning it green. In 2017-18, the EPA clean-up was conducted as a “removal” of “imminent threat” to health and safety, but once it was done, the site was turned over to state pollution experts to decide whether more money and effort was needed for “remediation,” Kecskemeti said. The initial $1.5 million “was not intended to clean up everything,” she said, adding: “We knew there was contamination in the soil," which would need to be addressed eventually; but because there was no threat to drinking water or otherwise threaten public health, "the site did not meet the criteria for a Superfund listing." “What this incident shows us is that we didn’t have a full sense of what was underground,” she said. As water accumulated in the basement pit, pressure built up and suddenly, perhaps through some fissure in the soil, a subterranean stream of green began pushing out from under the old factory. <strong> Download the < a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/2019/09/17/detroit-free-press-app/2356070001/" target="_blank">Detroit Free Press app</a> for the latest breaking news, notifications, sports scores, weather updates and more!</strong> It may have found low resistance in the sand and gravel underlying the adjoining freeway service drive, then reached the perfect route into the freeway – a trench filled with pea gravel that carried an electrical conduit to the side of the freeway, for the convenience of MDOT work crews needing to illuminate temporary signs. “Right where that conduit comes out of the wall” is where the green gusher erupted, Kecskemeti said. The EPA expects to know by Friday just what the liquid contains, state and EPA officials said. According to a news release from EGLE, “there is no immediate threat to air quality or drinking water from this release (and) there are no nearby drinking water wells that would be affected from contaminated groundwater." The shoulder and lanes of I-696 were closed to prevent motorists from driving through the material, although the former gusher is little more than seepage now, and workers have spread absorbent material on the freeway shoulder, according to state and EPA officials. Construction and cleanup at the site of a chemical spill on I-696 in Madison Heights, Monday, Dec. 23, 2019. While the liquid is now cleaned up, there is now an absorbent material at the base of the spill. Unfortunately, hundreds and perhaps thousands of gallons of the contaminated green liquid probably ran into storm sewers and, ultimately, Lake St. Clair before clean-up crews arrived late Friday night. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller commended the quick response by state and federal agencies while also saying that the incident points out the need for a coordinated monitoring plan to protect Great Lakes water. “Michigan EGLE and EPA were quickly on the job and engaged in this clean-up on what was essentially a holiday weekend," Miller said. She called for the capture and treatment of all pollution that runs into storm drains on major freeways. “A single drop of this chromium-6 contamination that might enter the lake is one drop too much,” she said. Madison Heights Mayor Brian Hartwell said his city has wrestled with Sayers for years over the hazards at his company, hamstrung by laws that he said seem overly protective of polluters. "It's our opinion that sites like this just be removed. But this business owner is contesting that in court. In fact, we are due to start a trial with him in mid-January," Hartwell said. "I am actually relieved by the response to this from all levels of government. EPA has been very responsive. The state has been. But there should be more funding available for preventing this type of problem," Hartwell said. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong >MORE:</strong></span> Owner of Madison Heights plating firm shut down by MDEQ faces prison <em >Contact: blaitner@freepress.com</em>

 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Initial test results of soil and water samples taken from beside I-696 in Madison Heights — where a green gusher of polluted water spurted earlier from a freeway wall — showed “high levels of multiple contaminants" in the soil and groundwater. State and federal pollution officials said Friday that the samples of soil and groundwater were taken from beneath and near a former metal-plating factory, whose site is directly up the freeway embankment from the spot where a bright-green gusher of polluted groundwater began spurting from a freeway wall during the afternoon rush hour on Dec. 20. The site, on eastbound I-696 about a half-mile before Dequindre, led to an emergency environmental cleanup last weekend. The right lane of the freeway in the area, as well as the exit ramp at Couzens, will stay closed indefinitely while workers remain on the site, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Transportation said Friday. Next week, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will begin extracting dozens of soil borings as part of an effort to determine how seriously the soil is contaminated and how far the contamination has spread with flows of rain and groundwater, according to a news release Friday from the recently renamed Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy — or EGLE. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/11/06/madison-heights-chemical-firm-fined-1-4-m-owner-sent-prison/2509632001/" target="_blank">Madison Heights chemical firm fined $1.45M, owner sent to prison</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2019/12/18/wrong-home-demolished-detroit-adamo-group/2685696001/" target="_blank">Detroit's largest demolition contractor demolishes the wrong home — again</a></span> A greenish-yellow liquid flows through a retaining wall on I-696, triggering a lane closure Friday afternoon and haz-mat clean-up Friday night, Dec. 20, 2019. “Electro-Plating Services is responsible for contaminated liquid that migrated off-site onto the Interstate-696 freeway shoulder last week," prompting the emergency clean-up, said the release. Tests of water samples taken from storm sewers near the site showed levels of hexavalent chromium at 0.14 milligrams per liter, slightly higher than the standard for safe drinking water of 0.10 milligrams per liter, the release said. Hexavalent chromium, also known as chromium-6, is the same highly toxic, cancer-causing chemical that a giant California utility let contaminate drinking water, according to a lawsuit brought by activist Erin Brockovich, whose David-versus-Goliath battle became a movie in 2000 starring Julia Roberts. “You don’t want to touch it — you don’t want to go in that building,” EPA investigator Tricia Edwards, at the site on Monday, told a Free Press reporter and photographer. Flows into the storm sewer eventually enter Lake St. Clair, many miles away, and by then the concentrations of contamination would be “well below detectable levels although still a significant concern for incremental accumulation in the ecosystem,” the release said. Photo shows hazardous factory after the EPA cleaned up in December 2017 in Madison Heights. Tests also showed high levels of contaminants were found in the groundwater flowing out of the freeway embankment, including hexavalent chromium, trichloroethylene (TCE) and cyanide — all chemicals previously used in the metal-plating factory; and soil tests of samples from the freeway embankment also showed hexavalent chromium, as well as "multiple heavy metals and other contaminants," although at levels below the threshold considered hazardous for human contact, the release said. It continued: “Regulators continue to work on the site daily during the holiday weeks, conducting the following activities: daily vacuuming of nearby storm-sewer catch basins; maintenance of sump pumps that are collecting contaminated water, both from inside the facility and outside on the highway embankment; daily monitoring of air quality in the building, and preparing for the impact of expected rain and freezing weather." Electro-Plating Services was issued a cease and desist order from EGLE (then called MDEQ) in December 2016, “due to extreme mismanagement of hazardous waste that posed an immediate and substantial threat to the community,” according to EGLE. Photo shows hazardous factory after the EPA cleaned up in December 2017 in Madison Heights. In 2017 and 2018, the EPA conducted a $1.5-million emergency cleanup, removing the hazardous chemicals and pumping contaminated liquid from an earthen pit in the basement of the facility. In November 2019, the company owner Gary Sayers was convicted of operating an unlicensed hazardous waste storage facility, sentenced to one year in federal prison, and ordered to repay the EPA $1.5 million for cleanup costs. According to a state of Michigan official at the site Monday, last year’s cleanup removed the “imminent threat” to health and safety.

 The former Electro-Plating Services factory on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights is the source of a toxic green ooze of chemicals that leached into the ground water, officials say. Macomb County Public Works Commissioner Candice Miller stepped up her criticism of state and federal agencies over the cleanup of the “green ooze” contamination site in Madison Heights, saying harmful chemicals will end up in Lake St. Clair. Miller knocked a statement on Friday from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy — or EGLE — that there is no risk to drinking water intakes on Lake St. Clair from the contaminants leaching from a closed metal-plating factory. “Dilution is not a solution and that is not the correct response,” Miller replied in a statement released Sunday. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/28/epa-tests-green-spill-i-696-serious-pollution-chromium-6-erin-brockovich/2761288001/" target="_blank">EPA: Tests of green spill beside I-696 show serious pollution</a></span> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/28/epa-tests-green-spill-i-696-serious-pollution-chromium-6-erin-brockovich/2761288001/" target="_blank">EGLE on Friday</a> Miller — who has been sidelined in the cleanup because the spill is in neighboring Oakland County — was having none of that. "Sunday’s rainfall brings into sharp focus the danger to our Great Lakes and drinking water system from a contaminated business in Madison Heights that leached Chromium-6 and other chemicals on to I-696 and its underground drainage system," Miller said. "All storm water in metro Detroit is either absorbed into the ground or eventually ends up in Lake St. Clair or another portion of the Great Lakes system." Miller said both EGLE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency failed in the initial cleanup at Electro-Plating Services on 10 Mile Road where officials discovered a toxic mess of leaky vats, buckets and barrels of harmful chemicals in 2016.

" But we know it has to stop now. EGLE and EPA have to step up to protect our communities and our lake." In a statement last week, Miller had called the toxic waste coming from the closed factory "life-threatening and terrifying." “While this site is not in Macomb County, this site clearly demands an immediate response from all appropriate authorities until it is no longer a danger to our community and to our magnificent Great Lakes.

 A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Liquid appears to have been seeping in increasing amounts from an I-696 retaining wall for several years in the same Madison Heights location where a Google Street View images of the area on the freeway, just west of Dequindre, show what appears to be a small stream of clear liquid draining from the wall in the same spot beginning in at least July 2016. The amount of liquid seeping out appears to be increasing in an August 2018 photo, and even more in a photo from May 2019. There appears to be a small amount of greenish liquid at the base of the wall in the May photo. The pavement appears dry in eight Google map images of the spot taken at various times between 2008 and October 2015. The Free Press reviewed the Google photos after being alerted by a reader on Facebook. Google Maps street view image shows no liquid coming from crevice on I-696 retaining wall in October 2015.

Macomb County Public Works Director Candice Miller, who is not involved in the cleanup but has been actively monitoring the situation because of concerns about the contamination reaching Lake St. Clair, on Monday said the photos "don’t necessarily show chemicals leaking out on to the freeway but they show how such leaking could have possibly occurred."

 U.S. Rep. Andy Levin discussed the now-infamous green ooze has been leaking out of the condemned site in Madison Heights After metro Detroit leaders vented outrage over industrial pollution first spotted two weeks ago on I-696 in Madison Heights, state and federal officials — including one congressman — were at the site Thursday when technicians began a new stage in the cleanup: taking soil samples to test the dirt. The test results will be compared to national standards for contamination levels, and that could lead to authorities undertaking the costly step of digging up the ground under and beside a former metal-plating factory, environmental officials said. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Technicians planned to take about two dozen soil samples, called borings, all around the factory, as well as on the path that contaminated groundwater took as it traveled away from Electro-Plating Services, first seeping under the freeway’s service drive, then flowing in a subterranean stream down a freeway embankment, coursing through pea gravel that fills a trench that carries electrical power to the freeway shoulder on eastbound I-696. It was through a crack in the shoulder wall that rush-hour motorists on the afternoon of Dec. 20 reported seeing a bright-green gusher of water spurting onto the pavement. State and federal experts soon found that the liquid was groundwater contaminated with, among other chemicals, potentially deadly chromium-6. It's the carcinogenic chemical that was at the center of a lawsuit by California activist Erin Brockovich, whose David-vs-Goliath lawsuit against a giant utility became the subject of a movie with her name, starring Julia Roberts. The soil-sample work is to continue on Friday as technicians drilled down at least 10 feet or until they struck groundwater, then removed the soil for testing and left behind compact devices that collect accumulations of water, which also is to be tested, officials said. The technicians used ground-penetrating radar to avoid striking gas, water and electrical lines. An unexpected witness to the work was U.S. Rep. Andy Levin, D-Bloomfield Township. "I just decided as my first act of 2020 that I had to come out here and see what was going on," Levin said. Rep. Andy Levin, of Michigan's 9th Congressional district, stops by to check on the progress being made at the now-closed Electro-Plating Services plant near I-696 freeway in Madison Heights on Thursday, Jan. 2, 2020. "I'm gratified to see both the state and federal agencies have people out here, working super-hard. My goal is to figure out what we could do in the United States House of Representatives, with our partners in the Senate, to make sure these agencies have the resources they need to get these places cleaned up," he said, adding that there were thousands of similar sites across the country that need cleanups. Levin took aim at Oakland County for adding to Macomb's environmental woes. "This situation is a big symbol of how the toxic crap from Oakland County flows right into Macomb County" and then into Lake St. Clair, "which we all share," he said, adding: "We can't have that." <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong > Read more:</strong></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/28/epa-tests-green-spill-i-696-serious-pollution-chromium-6-erin-brockovich/2761288001/" target="_blank">EPA: Tests of green spill beside I-696 show serious pollution</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><a data-track -label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/30/i-696-green-ooze-photos-hexavalent-chromium/2775265001/" target="_blank">Photos show I-696 green ooze site may have been leaking since at least 2016</a></span> The cleanup – with an estimated cost not yet available – follows a $1.5-million initial cleanup conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency when the agency forced the factory to close and charged its owner with improperly storing hazardous wastes. State and federal agencies could clean up many more such sites if funding were available, officials at the site have said repeatedly. Watching Thursday’s soil-boring work was Tracy Kecskemeti, district coordinator in southeast Michigan for EGLE — the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. “This site is a drastic reminder that we actually have thousands of sites around Michigan where the soil and groundwater are contaminated but we only have the resources to address a small number of them,” Kecskemeti said. “This site is attracting a lot of attention and we appreciate the advocacy we’re hearing for clean water. But we still have thousands of other sites that aren’t getting this attention,” Kecskemeti said. “You can’t see groundwater contamination, so it’s easy for people to ignore. If the expressway wasn’t there and people hadn’t seen this problem become so visible , we wouldn’t be here, and this site wouldn’t be getting this kind of attention today,” she said. “Because nobody around here is drinking this groundwater” — the nearest water well is more than 2 miles away, according to EGLE — “this site actually does not reach the same threshold of hazard of other sites that we have made a priority. I’m not saying I think this situation here is OK, not at all. But with limited resources, we have to prioritize,” Kecskemeti said. The owner of the defunct factory, Gary Sayers, is scheduled to report to federal prison no later than mid-January, after he pleaded guilty last year to storing hazardous chemicals. Sayers also was fined $1.5 million, the cost of the EPA cleanup of his factory in 2018-19. <em>Contact Bill Laitner: blaitner@freepress.com</em>

 U.S. Rep. Andy Levin discussed the now-infamous green ooze has been leaking out of the condemned site in Madison Heights When state regulators and the Madison Heights Fire Department entered Electro-Plating Services Inc. in Madison Heights in November 2016, they found an environmental house of horrors. Inside were more than 5,000 containers of toxic waste stored so haphazardly, in a building in such disrepair, that there was genuine fear of an imminent explosion or poisonous gas release into the nearby residential neighborhood, federal court records and state agency documents show. EPS, the troubled chrome-plating company at 945 E. 10 Mile Road, is blamed for the In this 2016 photo, a pit dug into the basement of Electro-Plating Service's Inc.'s building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights, where the owner allegedly dumped hazardous chemicals illegally, was discovered by state and federal regulators. Amid the squalor were leaking barrels of sodium cyanide, stored next to uncovered, corroding plating baths full of acids, all "exposed to precipitation from the holes in the roof and windows," Assistant U.S. Attorney Sara Woodward wrote in an October sentencing memorandum for EPS owner Gary Sayers in U.S. District Court in Detroit. According to  the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sodium cyanide reacts violently with strong oxidants such as acids, "causing an explosion hazard. " It also "releases highly flammable and toxic hydrogen cyanide gas on contact with acids or water." That gas "can be rapidly fatal," according to the CDC. Hydrogen cyanide gas was used to execute prisoners in the gas chamber for years in the U.S., before its use was discontinued in the 1990s amid rising criticism of the slow, painful deaths it caused the executed. The dilapidated first floor of the Electro-Plating Services building on 10 Mile Road in Madison Heights. The sodium cyanide's hazardous storage, so close to water and other chemicals that could have made it volatile, is particularly alarming, said Michael Murray, staff scientist with the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation's Great Lakes Regional Center. Improperly stored sodium cyanide is believed to have played a role in a "In the case of the EPS facility, even with presumably smaller volumes of sodium cyanide in storage, there could still be an appreciable risk to the local community with any type of accident involving either water intrusion into the drums or an explosion involving other chemicals, resulting in the release of hydrogen cyanide gas," Murray said. If firefighters arriving on the scene, unaware of what they were dealing with, then sprayed the fire with their hoses, it would create a situation similar to what occurred in the Tianjin disaster, he said. Sayers pleaded guilty to illegal storage of hazardous waste in February, and was sentenced to a year in federal prison in November, along with a requirement to pay restitution for cleanup costs of nearly $1.5 million. Sayers and his company had been on the radar of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality — now known as the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, or EGLE — for 20 years before the findings at the site in 2016. EGLE had sent the company a "letter of warning" over its mishandling of hazardous materials in late December 1996, following an inspection of its Madison Heights location. The state agency sent three more warning letters to Sayers, following further site inspections in October 2004 and June 2005. The third letter was for Sayers allegedly illegally transporting 535 55-gallon drums of hazardous waste from his Madison Heights location to another property in Detroit, where they were then illegally stored. Sayers pleaded guilty to a related charge in November 2005, and was released from probation two years later when the wastes were removed and disposed of with Dynecol, Inc., a waste management firm. Site cleanup at the time was overseen by EGLE. On April 13, 2010, EGLE and Sayers entered into a consent order in which EPS agreed not to store hazardous waste more than 90 days, to analyze all waste generated for hazardous characteristics, to maintain all waste characterization analysis documents, and to properly label all containers with hazardous waste. EGLE then sent Sayers and EPS a violation notice in June 2016, after an inspection the month before showed he was not following his promises. The Madison Heights Fire Department revoked the EPS building's occupancy that May for fire and building code violations. After not receiving a formal response to the June 2016 violation notice, EGLE and fire department staff re-entered the building on Nov. 15, 2016. "An estimated 5,000 containers of known and potential hazardous waste, hazardous chemicals and unknown waste are present at the facility, which has unrestricted access," EGLE Senior Environmental Quality Analyst Alexandra Clark wrote in a Dec. 16, 2016, briefing on the situation. "A residential neighborhood is within 500 feet of the facility and Interstate 696 is immediately adjacent to the facility, resulting in the potential to expose residents and passersby in the event of a fire, release, or curious children entering the facility. " EGLE officials noted the freeway area was frequented by more than 350,000 vehicles a day, and multiple schools, day care centers and senior centers were within a 1-mile radius of the building. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services declared the conditions at the property "an imminent and substantial hazard to public health" that December. EGLE ordered the company to cease and desist operations, and the city fire department put the facility on a 24-hour "fire watch." An EPA Superfund team then got involved, instituting a more than yearlong cleanup that included removing more than 5,000 containers of hazardous waste, and pumping 37,000 gallons of hexavalent chromium-contaminated water from a pit Sayers had dug in the basement of the facility, in which he improperly dumped wastes. The pit was backfilled and compacted with crushed gravel. EPA officials, in a statement, said they also conducted contaminant testing on the ground surrounding the building. "Upon discovering contamination at depth, EPA referred the site to Michigan EGLE to evaluate it for potential longer-term remediation," EPA officials stated. How the company was able to fall into such dangerous disrepair and haphazard storage while under at least two decades of DEQ/EGLE scrutiny, inspections and citations is something agency officials are examining. "Our focus right now is on addressing the contamination," EGLE spokesman Hugh McDiarmid Jr. said in an email. " As that effort is completed, we will be evaluating what happened in previous years." Electro-Plating's site violations occurred over decades, through multiple administrations and directors, amid shifting philosophies of pollution enforcement, he said. "While it is too early to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of the regulatory system as a whole, it is clear more should have been done at Electro-Plating to address unsafe practices, and much earlier in the process." <em>Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

 U.S. Rep. Andy Levin discussed the now-infamous green ooze has been leaking out of the condemned site in Madison Heights The man blamed for last month’s spurt of noxious freeway pollution north of Detroit — a geyser of carcinogenic chemical that drew the tongue-in-cheek labels “green slime” and “green ooze” — reported to federal prison Friday, Madison Heights officials said. Gary Sayers, 77, was sentenced in November to serve a year in prison, after Sayers pleaded guilty to illegally storing hazardous materials at the small metal-plating firm that he inherited from his father, according to court documents. In late December, the defunct factory sent a spurt of noxious pollution down a freeway embankment, catching the attention of thousands of motorists on eastbound I-696, just before Dequindre, causing the closure of the right lane and the exit at Couzens — expected to last through most of January. According to Sayers’ defense attorney, the aging businessman should have gotten no more than probation. In a pre-sentence memo submitted to federal court, Sterling Heights attorney James Thomas characterized Sayers as an object of pity, saying he has lost his business, sometimes seems to be confused, is “contrite, humbled and embarrassed to be a convicted felon,” and that “prior to his plea, he was reported to be living out of his car.” Sayers inherited an auto supplier that produced chrome-plated steel, a once-lucrative industry in metro Detroit. But the lawyer's memo said his client recently supported himself “by scrapping metal” and “selling off his assets.” The memo adds that Sayers “reads the Wall Street Journal and often quotes prominent conservative writers." <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong > More</strong>: <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2020/01/05/i-696-ooze-electro-plating-services/2806076001/" target="_blank">Company that caused I-696 ooze called 'imminent' hazard in 2016</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/30/i-696-green-ooze-photos-hexavalent-chromium/2775265001/" target="_blank">Photos show I-696 green ooze site may have been leaking since at least 2016</a></span> As expected, a companion pre-sentence memo filed by federal prosecutors told a different story. It said Sayers was president and owner of his firm for 23 years and that he'd had “numerous run-ins with environmental authorities” for decades over his repeated violations of hazardous waste laws, including a prior criminal conviction, and that Sayers knew exactly what those laws required him to do. “Despite all this, he knowingly and persistently violated the law,” the prosecutors wrote, as they advised the judge to follow federal guidelines with a prison sentence of 12 to 18 months. “By avoiding the upfront costs of disposing of the hazardous wastes appropriately, he caused the government to pay for a more costly cleanup,” tallied at nearly $1.5 million, the report said, adding: “His prior sentence of probation failed to deter him from re-engaging in violating hazardous waste laws.” Anticipating that the judge would demand that Sayers pay a fine to cover the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's costly cleanup, prosecutors pointed out that the defendant was far from being a subsistence-level metal scrapper forced to sleep in his car. He owned a valuable building in Detroit and it was for sale, they said: “Sayers recently signed an agreement to sell the property located at 5900 Commonwealth in Detroit for $2,500,000, which he stated he purchased for $125,000.00. No balance or mortgage exists for the property.” The memo was signed by four federal prosecutors, including Matthew Schneider, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan; and Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general in the Environment & Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Although Sayers has reported to prison, his lawyer will be back in court soon, or so Madison Heights officials hope. "We sued him for several things," including a demand that Sayers demolish his contaminated, blighted former factory, said Madison Heights City Manager Melissa Marsh. The city has tried since 2017 to get the building razed, Marsh said. "Unlike what people say on Facebook, we can't just seize a building," she said. The city has a court date of Jan. 13 with Sayers, and "they've tried to delay that because he's now in prison, but we're not accepting his delay," she said Friday. Whether Sayers' lawyer will succeed with a motion to postpone the trial is up to Oakland Circuit Judge Hala Jarbou. Although Sayers has a long history of noncooperation with authorities at all levels of regulation, there was a recent time when he offered crucial assistance, and officials gratefully accepted. That was on the evening of Dec. 20, when groundwater turned green from the factory's toxic chemicals spurted from the freeway wall just below Sayers' property. Called by a friend — Paul Tamm, who operates a nearby wholesale seller of used industrial machines — Sayers drove to the scene of his crime, Tamm said. "I told him, 'Gary, you'd better come over here because there's trucks and police and all kinds of stuff going on,' so he came over," Tamm said. Sayers was immediately met by federal and state environmental officials, who'd been unable to enter his property, they told the Free Press. "EPA could not enter the Electro-Plating property until the owner first signed a release," confirmed an email, without further details, from the EPA's regional office in Chicago. Likewise, staff from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy could not enter until Sayers signed a one-year release, which will allow long-term monitoring of the site, a state spokeswoman said Friday. <strong>More: </strong> Gov.

 U.S. Rep. Andy Levin discussed the now-infamous green ooze has been leaking out of the condemned site in Madison Heights State pollution fighters just found a new worry at the site of hazardous waste nicknamed “green slime” in Madison Heights — and they were rushing Friday night to Detroit to property owned by the same polluter. The new worry in Madison Heights is that tests showed elevated levels of the noxious “forever chemical,” or PFAS, found in contaminated water at the site. The water was collected from a pit in the basement of a former metal-plating factory, state environmental officials announced Friday. The pit was hand-dug into the ground by the company owner Gary Sayers — or so Sayers told investigators last year — and the hidden hole illegally allowed waste chemicals to collect there, ultimately contaminating the ground around and under the pit, state and federal officials have said. In Detroit, state environmental officials were on the way Friday night to a property that Sayers owned in Detroit, after Detroit firefighters identified potentially hazardous liquids at the location: 5900 Commonwealth St. When the site was inspected in December as part of a probe of Sayers’ properties, some potentially hazardous liquids escaped detection, said a news release from EGLE — the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy. Construction and cleanup at the site of a chemical spill on I-696 in Madison Heights, Monday, Dec. 23, 2019. While the liquid is now cleaned up, there is now an absorbent material at the base of the spill. EGLE investigators will inspect the scene Friday night, then “determine next steps and ensure the site is properly secured,” the release said. Court records show that Sayers had planned to sell the property, and he may have done so by now, as part of his sentencing in November. Sayers began serving a Test results from EGLE showed elevated levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, a group of poisons known overall as PFAS, according to a news release. The water sampled from Sayers’ basement pit contained levels of PFOS — one of the PFAS compounds — at a level of 742 parts per trillion, more than 10 times above Michigan’s groundwater standard of 70 parts per trillion. Before Friday’s disturbing test results were released, pollution fighters with powerful pumps at the site removed a tanker truckload of polluted water, all of it turned a sickly green by exposure to cancer-causing chromium-6 chemicals. The cleanup at Electro-Plating Services drew national attention when motorists on Dec. 20 saw green effluent spurting from a crack in a retaining wall of the freeway just north of Detroit. That night and the following day, a crew hired by the EPA began sucking up more than 11,000 gallons of polluted rain and groundwater from inside and beside the vacant factory. In a photo shot Jan. 2, 2020, a "Condemned" sign dated 12/21/16 covers a door at former metal-plating shop, which Madison Heights officials sought for years to have demolished. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/30/i-696-green-ooze-photos-hexavalent-chromium/2775265001/" target="_blank">Photos show I-696 green ooze site may have been leaking since at least 2016</a></span> <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2019/12/24/after-earlier-clean-up-toxic-green-gusher-696-brings-back-epa/2738523001/ " target="_blank">Green ooze came from Madison Heights factory and photos inside are shocking</a></span> EPA officials said Friday that at least two workers will be on the site this weekend, day and night, maintaining pumps that will continue removing contaminated liquid during rainfall expected Friday night and Saturday. EGLE officials stressed that any PFAS contamination that may have flowed from the site into storm sewers, and thence into Lake St. Clair, is not a concern for southeast Michigan's drinking water intakes. Six rounds of drinking water intake testing showed either no detections for PFAS, or very low levels. "All results are below both the existing EPA advisory level and below Michigan’s proposed new drinking water standards," officials said in the EGLE release. Drinking water systems that draw water from Lake St. Clair include Mount Clemens, Ira Township, Grosse Pointe Farms and New Baltimore. Detroit’s far bigger system, serving millions across southeast Michigan, draws much of its water from an intake pipe at the head of the Detroit River, where Lake St. Clair narrows.

 An aerial video of the Detroit property contaminated with uranium and other dangerous chemicals partially collapsed into the Detroit River. The shoreline continues to erode at the site of a November dock collapse on the Detroit River: Aggregate and contaminated soil are still entering the river and now a sinkhole has developed. The owner of the collapsed dock site, and the company leasing it to store large piles of aggregate, are not doing enough to prevent further shoreline erosion and contain the spilled materials, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy informed the companies Thursday. EGLE staff expressed concerns about the interim response efforts in letters sent Thursday to Revere Dock LLC, affiliated with Erickson's Inc. of Muskegon, which owns the riverfront dock area that collapsed on West Jefferson Avenue near Historic Fort Wayne; and to Detroit Bulk Storage Inc., which was storing the aggregate piles on the site. The companies had submitted their response plans to EGLE on Jan. 10. Among EGLE staff's listed concerns: EGLE is giving the companies until Jan. 24 to revise and submit a new Interim Response Plan, which is to detail longer-term and more specific plans to remediate the site. "That plan must include an assessment of the sinkhole and proposed measures to ensure further contaminated soils and aggregate are not discharged into the Detroit River," an EGLE statement said. A message left with Detroit Bulk Storage was not returned Thursday afternoon. A woman answering the phone at Erickson's said the only person who could comment, company president Steve Erickson, was not available. <strong>More:</strong> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/2020/01/16/egle-696-green-ooze-site-cost-millions -clean-up-electro-plating-services-gary-sayers/4481293002/" target="_blank">I-696 green ooze site cleanup to cost 'millions' — and taxpayers will likely foot the bill</a> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/2020/01/09/green-ooze-i-696-barrels-michigan-thumb-gary-sayers/2847199001/" target="_blank">Property owner blamed for green ooze on I-696 left barrels strewn on Thumb land</a> < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2019/12/10/detroit-bulk-storage-had-similar-detroit-river-bank-collapse-2011/2634462001/" target="_blank">Detroit Bulk Storage had similar Detroit River bank collapse in 2011</a> The city of Detroit’s Buildings, Safety Engineering and Environmental Department An old wood, concrete and asphalt dock and seawall partially collapsed Nov. 26 at the former Revere Copper and Brass site. Detroit Bulk Storage was leasing the site from Erickson's to store large piles of limestone aggregate along the river. A ship dropped off a large pile of aggregate at the site about a day before the collapse, and heavy rains may have been a factor. The spill created great concern, as the Revere site at one time contained radioactive materials from the days when it was utilized for atomic bomb component and uranium rod development in the 1940s and 1950s. But testing by both the Great Lakes Water Authority, which has drinking water intakes in the Detroit River, and EGLE turned up no excessive amounts of radioactivity. Further testing found no excessive levels of industrial contaminants in the river water near the collapse site. State Rep. Tyrone Carter, D-Detroit, expressed dismay, but not surprise, at the news Thursday that EGLE has found the companies' response to the shoreline collapse inadequate. "If the violators are left to clean up the violation, how do we know it was done well and done right?" he said. "There’s no trust that they’re going to do it the right way. There has to be a mechanism where you can bring in a third party to do it the right way." <em>Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com. Follow on Twitter @keithmatheny.</em>

 U.S. Rep. Andy Levin discussed the now-infamous green ooze has been leaking out of the condemned site in Madison Heights A hazardous waste processing facility in Detroit has received state approval to increase its storage of toxic wastes ninefold, after years of delay because of strong opposition from neighbors. US Ecology's facility at 6520 Georgia St., just north of I-94 near the Hamtramck border, is permitted to process 144,000 gallons, or more than 4,500 tons, of toxic chemicals and metals from industry daily, including PCBs, mercury, arsenic, PFAS and more. The permit approval announced Thursday by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) allows the company to expand its on-site storage capability from 76,118 gallons to nearly 677,000 gallons. "They are declaring Detroit and Wayne County the toxic waste dumping ground for the nation, including radioactive fracking waste," said state Rep. Isaac Robinson, D-Detroit. Robinson was referring to Technologically Enhanced Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material, or TENORM, a natural waste formed during hydraulic fracturing, or fracking — oil and gas well activity that contains radioactivity slightly above naturally occurring background levels. But per an agreement with the City of Detroit, US Ecology stopped processing TENORM wastes at its Georgia Street facility four years ago, company spokesman David Crumrine said. Among the wastes accepted at the Georgia Street facility is PFAS, the nonstick compounds that don't break down in nature and are now known to cause health problems in humans. The US Ecology permit approval took more than five years of consideration, as nearby residents packed public hearings and multiple public protests were held outside the facility. The Rev. Sharon Buttry, who lives in Hamtramck about 2 miles from the US Ecology site, helped lead a grassroots coalition opposed  to the facility's expansion. "I am very disappointed," she said. "I thought that Gov. (Gretchen) Whitmer would possibly step in, with her commitment to environmental justice, and halt the expansion of this plant." US Ecology fulfilled all of its permit requirements, and EGLE felt compelled to approve the permit based on existing law, Buttry said. And that's the problem, she said. "What's become abundantly clear is we need better laws to protect communities — especially low-income communities of people of color — from expansion of hazardous waste burdens around them," she said. The amount of hazardous waste the state permits US Ecology to process at the Georgia Street facility per day — up to 144,000 gallons —and the amount of treated chemical waste it is allowed to discharge as effluent into the sewer system managed by the Great Lakes Water Authority — up to 300,000 gallons per day — are not changing as a result of the approved storage expansion, EGLE officials said. US Ecology provides "safe and compliant waste treatment" for its industrial customers, Crumrine said. "This and other facilities in the US Ecology network provide important public and private remediation and cleanup efforts, including PFAS remediation and cleanup of the 'green ooze' waste spill along I-696 in Madison Heights," he said. "This facility is a vital part of the solution to provide safe and compliant waste management options." Richard Conforti, a supervisor in EGLE's Hazardous Waste Management Division, said the expansion effort at US Ecology's Georgia Street facility began back in 2012, when US Ecology purchased the facility from Dynecol. The state agency was prepared to approve US Ecology's expansion in 2015, but a large public outcry led to a more deliberate process. "We spent a lot of time going through this," Conforti said. "The public did have a good impact on this." U.S. Ecology at the I-94 Industrial park area near the Detroit City airport on Wednesday, May 25, 2016. Conforti cited a requirement that trucks transporting waste to US Ecology use a dedicated truck route, in response to nearby residents' concerns about truck traffic through their neighborhoods. US Ecology is also now required to send information on its operations directly to Detroit's Building Safety, Engineering and Environmental Department (BSEED), with EGLE no longer required to serve as a middle man, another change made at the request of the public, he said. Crumrine said US Ecology has no plans to commence work on storage modifications at this point, and will initiate work "as business dictates in the future. " The company has up to three years to complete the new buildings and expanded storage facilities approved in the permit, or the approval process would again be required and the process would start anew, Conforti said. <strong>More:</strong> <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/2020/01/16/egle-696-green-ooze-site-cost-millions -clean-up-electro-plating-services-gary-sayers/4481293002/" target="_blank">I-696 green ooze site cleanup to cost 'millions' — and taxpayers will likely foot the bill</a> < a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2020/01/05/i-696-ooze-electro-plating-services/2806076001/" target="_blank">Company that caused I-696 ooze called 'imminent and substantial hazard' in 2016</a> EGLE understands neighbors are opposed to this expansion. "The facility's been there since the 1970s, and it's in an area that's zoned heavy industrial," Conforti said. "We abide by the laws that the legislators put forth, and that's how we do our permits. ... We've put a license together that will protect the public health and environment." Part of the time delay in deciding upon the permit involved creating permit-related documents translated into Arabic and Bengali to expand the public engagement to the large immigrant populations, particularly in nearby Hamtramck, Conforti said. But Sam Alasri, a nearby resident to US Ecology's Georgia Street facility and chairman of the Yemeni-American Political Action Committee, who understands written and spoken Arabic, said the EGLE-provided documents on US Ecology in Arabic "make no sense." "It's not understandable," he said. Many of the non-English speakers, or those for whom English is not a first language, in the heavily immigrant-populated area have had difficulty engaging in the permit process, Alasri said. "Most of my community, they don't know what's happened," he said. "These facilities need to be outside of the city — and outside of the state. The government is going to an area of people of color — Bengali, Yemeni immigrants, African immigrants — and dumping radioactive waste. Why don't they take it to other places? We see environmental racism here." <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/11/16/usecology-hazardous-waste-detroit-sewer/89963514/" target="_blank">A November 2016 Free Press investigation</a> "This has been a bad actor — they haven't handled waste well at a (76,000 gallon) capacity," Robinson said. Company officials countered that excessive levels of contamination found in their sewer releases were infrequent, found in less than 1% of sampling and never jeopardized public health, the environment, or processes at the wastewater treatment plant. EGLE and water authority officials concurred. Robinson cited the context in which the vast expansion of the hazardous waste processing facility is being approved — as the Flint water crisis still resonates, as toxic green ooze flows onto a busy metro Detroit highway, and the polluters' left-behind wastes are still being found in Detroit, the Thumb and perhaps other locations. "Even in that context, corporations can muscle a state government to get what they want — they can muscle city government to get what they want," he said. "It's a sad state of affairs." There is an overconcentration of toxic waste in Wayne County, Robinson said. "The fight continues — I'm up for it, and the people I represent are up for it," he said. "We need to stop this movement of other states dumping their dangerous chemicals here in our community." <em>Contact Keith Matheny: 313-222-5021 or kmatheny@freepress.com.

 By The Associated Press <p>PORTAGE, Ind. — A water sample from Lake Michigan near a wastewater spill at a U.S. Steel plant in Indiana contained an elevated level of a potentially carcinogenic chemical but well below federal safety standards, the Chicago Department of Water Management said Thursday.</p> PORTAGE, Ind. — A water sample from Lake Michigan near a wastewater spill at a U.S. Steel plant in Indiana contained an elevated level of a potentially carcinogenic chemical but well below federal safety standards, the Chicago Department of Water Management said Thursday. A sample containing 2 parts per billion of hexavalent chromium was taken in the lake about a mile north of the spill in Portage, Indiana, about 30 miles east of Chicago, the agency said. That's "a level higher than would be expected to be found in raw lake water," the department said in a news release, but it's just a fraction of the Environmental Protection Agency's drinking water standard of 100 parts per billion for all forms of chromium. A second sample taken nearby contained 1.6 parts per billion of hexavalent chromium, but 10 other samples taken in the same general area contained levels no higher than 0.21 parts per billion, agency data showed. The EPA expects to start receiving results Friday from about 200 water samples it has collected following the Tuesday spill, spokeswoman Rachel Bassler said. "Preliminary data suggests that hexavalent chromium from the spill is not present near drinking water intakes," Bassler said. The EPA has said hexavalent chromium — a toxic byproduct of industrial processes — might be carcinogenic if ingested. The toxic heavy metal is used in a variety of industrial processes, including steelmaking and corrosion prevention, and as a pigment in dyes, paints and inks. It's also found in ash from coal-fired power plants. A case involving the chemical was made famous by the 2000 film "Erin Brockovich," which was based on a utility's disposal of water laced with hexavalent chromium in unlined ponds near Hinkley, California. That disposal method polluted drinking water wells and resulted in a $333 million settlement. U.S. Steel has said its release of the chemical was stopped at the source. It's not known yet how much was spilled, Bassler said. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel condemned the company's "careless conduct." "U.S. Steel must immediately explain how they allowed a dangerous chemical into a Lake Michigan tributary where it could harm millions of people in Indiana and Illinois, and what they are doing to ensure this never happens again," Emanuel said in a statement Thursday. U.S. Steel issued a statement Thursday evening saying it's identified the source of Tuesday's spill and "has made the necessary repairs." "We are reviewing a potential restart plan to best serve our customers, employees and the community," the company said. U.S. Steel previously said that an expansion joint failed in a pipe, allowing wastewater to flow into the wrong treatment plant at the Portage complex. That wastewater eventually flowed into the Burns Waterway, a lake tributary, at a point about 100 yards from Lake Michigan. A water utility stopped drawing water from the lake and three beaches at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and one in adjacent Ogden Dunes have been closed as a precaution.

 <p >Harmful algae blooms have become a top water polluter, fueled by fertilizers washing into lakes, streams and oceans. Federal and state programs have spent billions of dollars on cost-sharing payments to farmers to help prevent nutrient runoff, yet the problem is worsening in many places. Here's a look at the algae menace and what's being done:</p> Harmful algae blooms have become a top water polluter, fueled by fertilizers washing into lakes, streams and oceans. Federal and state programs have spent billions of dollars on cost-sharing payments to farmers to help prevent nutrient runoff, yet the problem is worsening in many places. Here's a look at the algae menace and what's being done: ANCIENT ORGANISMS, NEW THREAT Among the oldest life forms, algae are simple aquatic plants that form key links in food chains. Some types of bacteria are also considered algae, including cyanobacteria, or "blue-green algae," which is increasingly common across the U.S. Scientists believe a combination of factors can trigger large blooms, including warm temperatures, slow water circulation and excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Among nutrient sources are runoff from farms and urban lawns as well as industrial wastes and sewage. Some blooms generate toxins such as microcystin, which can cause nausea, fever and liver damage in humans and kill animals. A federal study detected microcystin in nearly 40 percent of lakes sampled around the nation, although mostly at below-harmful levels. Even when blooms aren't toxic, they can turn waters ugly shades of green or other colors, stink like rotten vegetables, foul beaches and kill fish by sucking oxygen from the water as they decompose. A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM The U.S. isn't alone. Many countries are experiencing "disturbing trends of increasing bloom incidence" and growing economic losses, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. China's largest blooms on record washed onto beaches in 2013 from the Yellow Sea, as bulldozers scraped up rotting mats by the ton. A bloom the size of Mexico spreads across the Arabian Sea twice a year. In Australia, blue-green algae extended more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) on the Murray River in 2016. A European Commission study says blooms in Greece, Italy and Spain cost the economy $355 million (300 million euros) annually. University of Alberta researchers say microcystin has been detected in more than 240 Canadian water bodies. Lake Winnipeg algae blooms are so large that they're visible from space. IS CLIMATE CHANGE BEHIND THIS? Many scientists believe global warming is making conditions more favorable for algae blooms, primarily by raising water temperatures and causing heavier rainstorms that wash more nutrients into waterways. A study in the journal Science this year said nitrogen runoff into lakes, rivers and bays could increase 19 percent by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions keep rising. Climate change research in the journal Environmental Science and Technology predicts the number of days U.S. reservoirs are infected with blue-green blooms could triple by 2050. PLAYING CATCH-UP Congress first enacted legislation to deal with harmful algae in 1998 and has updated it several times, with another version pending. Critics say it's too little and too slow. A White House report last year said progress had been made in forecasting blooms and issuing warnings. The Governmental Accountability Office said 12 agencies had spent $101 million on studies and monitoring between 2013 and 2015. But only in 2014 was the law updated to make inland waters a priority; the focus previously had been on coastal areas and the Great Lakes. Even then, no funding was included for inland water study. And the law sidesteps the nutrient runoff problem, with no limits and no enforcement provisions. WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION MEASURES? The Associated Press obtained data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the costliest of several programs that help farmers avoid pollution. The agency awarded $1.8 billion between 2009 and 2016 for use of 45 practices intended to prevent fertilizer runoff. The five most heavily funded included upgrading irrigation systems; managing brush growth; planting "cover crops" in fall and winter that hold soil in place and absorb fertilizers; stabilizing erosion-prone areas used by livestock; and developing plans for applying fertilizer in ways that will minimize runoff. Another popular measure is planting grass or other vegetation between croplands and streams. Farmers in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Indiana and Nebraska were pledged the most funding between 2009 and 2016. Farmers in Sussex County, Delaware, a top poultry-producing area, received $17 million over the seven years, the most of any U.S. county.

In the Holland-Zeeland area, we have one of the most safe and abundant water supply coming from Lake Michigan. But just 30 miles east of here in the Rockford area, contaminated ground water wells have been found to have high levels of a dangerous chemical. This chemical, PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), came from the Wolverine Co. makers of Hush Puppies and were dumped on land where many homes now are located. Needless to say, some serious medical issues are being linked to this due to the contamination. The Trump administration has proposed budget cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency by at least 30 percent. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative which funds environmental cleanup is being cut by 90 percent. Many past regulations regarding the pollution of our lakes and oceans have been removed by EPA administrator Scott Pruitt. If there was a governmental agency that needs to have more funding, it would be the EPA. The 2016 Waters of the United States rule was suspended by Trump last year because he felt it interferes with economic development. It will also interfere with our health by suspending it. So Holland-Zeeland residents, don’t take your drinking water for granted! Write Rep. Bill Huizenga or Rep. Fred Upton and encourage them to fight against Trump’s anti-environmental policies. Your grandchildren and future generations depend on us to protect the safety of their waters and rivers. Wally Rooks

 <p>TRAVERSE CITY — Recent damage to underwater oil and electrical lines in the waterway connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan that's blamed for an insulation fluid spill was caused by a tugboat dragging its anchor, Michigan's attorney general said Tuesday.</p> TRAVERSE CITY — Recent damage to underwater oil and electrical lines in the waterway connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan that's blamed for an insulation fluid spill was caused by a tugboat dragging its anchor, Michigan's attorney general said Tuesday. Attorney General Bill Schuette said he notified VanEnkevort Tug & Barge that he's planning civil action against the company because of the damage believed to have been caused April 1 by the tug named Clyde S. VanEnkevort in the Straits of Mackinac. "The vessel ignored markers in the channel and clearly identified hazards on navigational charts that make clear that an anchor should not be deployed in this area of Straits," Schuette said in a statement. Company spokesman Darrell Wilson acknowledged that a tug and barge belonging to VanEnkefort, based in Escanaba, Michigan, were among vessels that transited the straits area the day the damage happened. "We are fully participating with all relevant authorities as they conduct the investigation," Wilson said in a statement, adding that it would be inappropriate to comment further. Wilson did not confirm or deny Schuette's contention that the vessel deployed an anchor while passing through the straits or that it was to blame for the damage. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading the investigation, joined by other state and federal agencies. Spokeswoman Ensign Pamela Manns said the probe was continuing and declined comment on Schuette's announcement. Two electric cables leaked 600 gallons (2,270 liters) of insulation fluid containing mineral oil and benzene. Enbridge Inc.'s twin Line 5 pipelines carry crude oil and liquefied natural gas. The company has said the pipelines were dented but that the integrity of the lines weren't compromised. Under Michigan law, causing such a leak is punishable by a civil fine of up to $25,000 per day of the discharge, as well as damages for harm to natural resources, attorney's fees and court costs, Schuette said. He said those responsible for the anchor deployment or maintenance also could face criminal charges or other legal liability. An anchor strike had been suspected in the damage, but officials hadn't previously released details, including of who might be responsible. Enbridge announced Monday afternoon it has restarted its Line 5, which was shut down over the weekend. The company blamed a power outage. Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan had pushed for a temporary shutdown because of high winds and heavy currents in the Straits of Mackinac. Line 5 carries 23 million gallons (87 million liters) of oil daily between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. The segment that crosses the 5-mile-wide (8-kilometer-wide) straits linking Lake Huron and Lake Michigan is divided into two side-by-side pipes that were laid on the lake bottom in 1953. The ruined power cables are owned by American Transmission Company. The Coast Guard and other agencies have been monitoring the straits by boat and air but have reported no sheen or other evidence of pollution. Plans call for using an underwater vehicle to check the damaged cables and pipelines.

 <p>WEST OLIVE — A town hall meeting on Feb. 8 will give people the opportunity to ask officials about PFAS contamination in Robinson Township.</p> WEST OLIVE — A town hall meeting on Feb. 8 will give people the opportunity to ask officials about PFAS contamination in Robinson Township. The meeting will take place in the main conference room from 5-7:30 p.m. at the Ottawa County Administrative Offices, 12220 Fillmore St. in West Olive. This is the first meeting that the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and Ottawa County Department of Public Health has held since early November 2018, after elevated levels of PFAS substances were detected in wells at Robinson Elementary School. In November and December, the DEQ sampled water from 66 total wells on and near 120th Avenue in the township, and traces of the substances were discovered in 34 of them. A high level of PFAS was found at the school and one residence. Since November, residents throughout Robinson Township have been relying on bottled water for drinking and cooking, have sought independent water sampling, and installed filters in their homes. The DEQ will conduct a hydrogeologic investigation in the coming weeks in hopes of drawing closer to the source of contamination. Kristina Wieghmink, the public information officer for the county health department, said the February meeting was scheduled due to requests from Robinson Township officials and community members. “We want to ensure Robinson Township residents and the public have information about PFAS and the opportunity to ask questions from local and state health officials on the PFAS testing in their area, and other concerns in the community,” she said. DEQ District Supervisor Abigail Hendershott, DEQ analyst Paul Knoerr, and Department of Health and Human Services toxicologist William Farrell will provide updates on the investigation and the health risks of exposure. Various other officials, including Robinson Township Supervisor Kathy Kuck and Grand Haven Area Public Schools Superintendent Andy Ingall, will be available for questions. Questions can be submitted in advance at www.surveymonkey.com/r/PFASTownMtgFeb2019. Four potential sources for the contamination were initially considered — including firefighting foam, undocumented dump sites, biosolid applications and highway construction materials. None of these potential culprits have been ruled out, but no strong links have been drawn, either. The Robinson Township Fire Department has never used Class B firefighting foam, which is known to contain PFAS chemicals. DEQ spokesperson Scott Dean told the Grand Haven Tribune this month that high concentrations of PFAS chemicals have not been discovered in close proximity to nearby biosolid applications or highway construction materials. No PFAS contamination sites under investigation in Michigan have been linked to biosolids, and no highway materials used in the construction of the M-231 bypass in Robinson Township have been identified containing PFAS. Dump sites have historically been allowed without documentation, Dean said, but none have been identified close to elevated PFAS levels in the township. Known as “forever chemicals,” PFAS substances are water and lipid resistant, found throughout the environment, and are used in common items such as water-repellent materials, fast-food wrappers and non-stick cookware. Human studies have linked the chemicals to numerous health hazards including forms of cancer, thyroid disease and elevated cholesterol. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a lifetime health advisory of 70 parts per trillion (ppt) in drinking water for the two chemicals PFOA and PFOS. Michigan has not established standards for drinking water, but the DEQ has investigated the contaminants across the state. U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Zeeland, joined legislators across the aisle in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday to announce a bipartisan congressional PFAS Task Force. In a statement, the congressman said task force leaders are concerned that contamination like what was discovered at Robinson Elementary School is “just the tip of the iceberg.” “At the end of the day, residents deserve to know the truth and the full picture about the health risks, as well as the sources associated with PFAS and PFOAS,” he said. Huizenga added that more research is needed to address whether the EPA’s lifetime health advisory limit is “the right number or, as we suspect, it needs to be much lower.”

 <p>ROBINSON TWP. — If you dig a 5-foot hole in Robinson Township, you’ll hit water.</p> ROBINSON TWP . — If you dig a 5-foot hole in Robinson Township, you’ll hit water. The area’s shallow aquifer is the subject of scrutiny this month as the Department of Environmental Quality digs wells in search of the source of PFAS contamination. Standing on the southeast end of the Robinson Elementary School grounds Thursday, DEQ geologist Paul Knoerr held up 5-foot cylindrical tube — called a sleeve — to show bands of coarse sediment laced amid fine wet sand. The soil sample had just emerged from around 25 feet beneath the school grounds. Geologists examined the sediment and recorded observations, picking through the pebbles, comparing the sand to a color matching chart. At 25 and 50 feet, water samples were collected. Knoerr said he expects both shallow and deep samples from the hydrogeologic investigation to reveal PFAS above 70 parts per trillion, as high concentrations were detected at the school in October. If this happens, the 120th Avenue area investigation will become an official PFAS contamination site — one of 43 around Michigan. Robinson Elementary is the only school in the state with these high readings, causing students and staff to rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking since fall. In November and December, the DEQ sampled more than 60 residential wells, mostly north of the school along 120th Avenue. Traces of PFAS have shown up throughout the area, but the school’s samples are still the highest concentrations. This means the source should be at or very near the school, according to Knoerr. If you dig about 50 feet, you reach a layer of clay at the bottom of the sandy aquifer. Knoerr said the geology is uniform and horizontal, flowing north toward the Grand River. Without a steep gradient, the groundwater moves slowly. But as sediment becomes more coarse and large-grain, it moves faster. PFAS tends to move toward water, and moves quickly through large-grain sediment. “The PFAS is going to run through the stuff that moves fast,” Knoerr said. “Wherever it goes, that stuff wants to hook into that water and it’s going to run. That’s why we’re seeing something here that might be impacting something a distance away from here.” PFAS was also discovered south of the school. Knoerr said agricultural irrigation in the area could temporarily alter the flow of groundwater, drawing it southward. A source could also be located farther south. The DEQ commonly cleans up well-understood chemicals. Gasoline, for instance, is lighter than water, and is usually found in the shallow soil. Dry cleaning solvent is denser than water, Knoerr said, and will sink below the water table. “We don’t know what happens with PFAS,” Knoerr said. He said the substances are likely denser than water, due to their large molecular structure, but the large group of chemical compounds linked to numerous health risks remains mysterious. Drilling deep, even with the powerful Geoprobe, involves a lot of waiting. Metal tubes are lined up to deliver the sleeve to the next layer of earth. “Every single time, everything’s got to come out of the hole and back down again,” Knoerr said. Monitoring wells are being placed around the school, and east across 120th Avenue on Robinson Township property. Sampling should last through next week, Knoerr said, and results are expected in about four weeks. Once the ice melts, the DEQ will also sample water from a few nearby ponds. If those results reveal PFAS, new exposure routes could be considered — such as through contaminated fish and deer. It’s possible that a source will never be discovered, Knoerr said. He described the investigative method as using Occam’s razor, a problem-solving principle that states that the simplest solutions are more likely to be correct than complex ones. A lot of the area’s wells lack documentation. Their depths are unknown. Environmental regulations were not in vogue before the 1970s, and potential sources, such as dump sites, may also lack documentation. The investigation is a journey into the past — to forgotten human activity, and to Michigan’s glacial origin.  “We’re trying to recreate history,” Knoerr said.

 <p>ST. LOUIS — Cleanup work has resumed at a former chemical plant in central Michigan that's become one of the country's costliest Superfund sites.</p> ST. LOUIS — Cleanup work has resumed at a former chemical plant in central Michigan that's become one of the country's costliest Superfund sites. An Environmental Protection Agency official, Thomas Alcamo, told MLive.com that it could still take another seven years to finish cleaning up the Velsicol Chemical plant site in St. Louis, Michigan. "I could see this going six or seven more years, it's really funding-dependent for a lot of it," Alcamo said. "It's extremely expensive." Volatile organic chemicals, such as DDT and polybrominated biphenyls, were left behind at the site when the plant closed roughly 40 years ago, seeping into the soil. The chemical DDT was also found to have leaked into the Pine River after the plant closed in 1978, costing over $100 million to clean up. The first phase of the cleanup process at the site wrapped up last fall, but the second phase that's underway covers an area that's three times larger, the Morning Sun reported . Workers removed nearly 30 tons of contaminated soil during the first phase. About 100,000 tons (91,000 metric tons) are planned for removal from the second area by 2021. Workers will be using a process to remove chemicals from the soil by inserting metal rods into the ground, which heat the chemicals to boiling. The chemicals are then siphoned off and destroyed. Alcamo said the second phase of the cleanup is estimated to cost up to $25 million, while the following phase will cost up to $20 million. Pine River Superfund Citizens Task Force, an EPA-sanctioned community group that's overseeing cleanup of the Superfund site, expressed concern about the toxic substance DBCP buried at the site. The chemical, which has been used as a soil fumigant and pesticide, is believed to lead to several health risks, such as decreased sperm counts in males. Jane Keon, the task force's secretary, said the air will be monitored around the site so that they can react to any potential exposure.

 The DNR is investigating a frac sand mine spill in western Wisconsin The state Department of Natural Resources is investigating a spill at a Jackson County frac sand mine. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the spill occurred Saturday at the 670-acre Wisconsin Proppants Hixton mine in the town of Curran northwest of Black River Falls. Town Chairman Dwight Swenson says he saw signs of a spill Saturday morning on Curran Coulee Creek and notified the DNR. He took photos of orange-colored water in the creek and about 2 miles downstream where the creek enters the Trempealeau River. DNR spokesman Andrew Savagian says it’s unclear what sort of material was released or how much. Investigators took water samples Tuesday and will continue to assess the impacts to the creek. The DNR said that the company is cooperating with DNR and has taken steps to stop the discharge and is using a vacuum truck to limit the release of sediment. No fish kills have been observed. <strong>Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

 Richfield Middle School was evacuated because of gas leak Friday morning and classes were canceled, the Washington County Sheriff's Office said. The students were taken by bus to Friess Lake Elementary, the department said. Firefighters with the Richfield Volunteer Fire Company were dispatched at 8:23 a.m. to the school at 3117 Highway 167. The first fire crews to arrive reported back to dispatchers that there were strong concentrations of natural gas in the building and that the building was being evacuated. Richfield firefighters and crews from We Energies shut off the natural gas supply to the building. No injuries were reported. The gas leak was caused by a cracked pipe on the roof of the school, Holy Hill Area School District Administrator Tara Villalobos said in a letter posted on the district's website and sent to parents through the district's message system. The pipe cracked due to changing winter weather conditions, she said. She said the scent of gas was noticed by the district's director of maintenance in the band room at the school. <strong>Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

 State regulators are asking Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport to investigate the source of toxic chemicals in stormwater flowing off the property. High levels of a family of toxic chemicals have been detected in stormwater flowing to Wilson Park Creek and Oak Creek from sites at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. The findings made public Friday by state officials suggest the compounds, known generically as PFAS, are making their way to Lake Michigan, the source of drinking water for nearly 900,000 residents in metropolitan Milwaukee. PFAS compounds were detected on airport property in three stormwater points that empty into the two creeks — sometimes at levels that far exceeded minimum thresholds the administration of Gov. Tony Evers is proposing for groundwater. Wilson Park Creek drains into the Kinnickinnic River and eventually Lake Michigan. Oak Creek flows directly to Lake Michigan. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the airport to determine the source and extent of the contamination, prevent future discharges and develop a cleanup plan. “We don’t want to see chemicals at these levels being discharged into the environment,” said Darsi Foss, the DNR's administrator of the division of environmental management. In August, the Journal Sentinel reported sampling in 2017 and 2018 showed PFAS chemicals The DNR said that the levels were not a public health concern but something for the water utility to monitor. PFAS chemicals are believed to be widespread and have been used for decades in industry and consumer products, ranging from fire retardants to nonstick pans. Epidemiology studies have suggested that they can lead to increased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, liver damage, thyroid disease, asthma, decreased fertility, some cancers and a decline in response to vaccines. The DNR had directed airport officials to test stormwater on the property because of past discoveries of the chemicals in soil and groundwater at the Air National Guard 128th Air Refueling Wing and the 440th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve. The 440th moved to a base in North Carolina in 2007. Airports and military sites are suspected problem areas for the chemicals because they use fire retardants containing PFAS compounds. Known as “forever chemicals” because of their difficulty in breaking down in the environment, PFAS compounds are coming under growing scrutiny across the country. Mitchell spokesman Harold Mester said in an email that the chemicals were used in firefighting but were discontinued in 2012 when the airport switched to a more environmentally friendly firefighting foam. Mester said airport officials believe the source of the chemicals appears to come from land used by others, including the 128th and the 440th. “Clearly, we need to be doing more testing for these chemicals,” said Cheryl Nenn of Milwaukee Riverkeeper, who said her group wants to see Mitchell move quickly to screen the contaminants from stormwater. Test results in April, May and June turned up about a half dozen compounds, including PFOA and PFOS, which have also been detected in other locations in the state. The highest concentration involved a compound, PFHxS, of nearly 80,000 parts per trillion, a figure that airport officials said could be misleading because of low water flow at the time of the test that can magnify readings. Still, other results from Mitchell showed concentrations far higher than those reported at Madison’s airport during the same period. Wisconsin has no health standards for PFAS, but is in the In June, the state Department of Health Services recommended a combined limit in PFOA and PFOS of 20 parts per trillion in groundwater. On a separate front, a coalition representing water and wastewater utilities said it is recommending members not start sampling wastewater for the chemicals as requested by the Evers administration. The Municipal Water Coalition said members are not the source but “receivers” of such chemicals. The group said it is developing ways to screen for the chemicals and work with dischargers to reduce their use of the chemicals. <strong>Our subscribers make this reporting possible.

 One of the 176th Fighter Squadron's F-16C fighters sits in the maintenance hangar as an airman cleans the floor at the Wisconsin Air National Guard 115th Fighter Wing based at Truax Field in Madison. A first round of sampling of hazardous chemicals by state environmental investigators found the highest concentrations in a Madison stream and in the Wisconsin River near Rhinelander. The Department of Natural Resources said Monday it found varying levels of contamination from perfluorinated chemicals, known generically as PFAS, in five locations identified earlier this year as probable locations. The highest concentrations tended to be found downstream from previously known contaminated sites or in streams with low water flow. None were in the Milwaukee area, although the DNR is monitoring contamination at the Air National Guard 128th Air Refueling Wing in Milwaukee. Some chemicals in the PFAS family may pose increased health risks, such as thyroid disease, low birth weights and cancer, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The samples were taken this summer in an effort to determine the extent of PFAS, or so-called “forever chemicals,” in surface waters across the state. The highest levels were found in Starkweather Creek on Madison’s east side near a fire training site at Truax Field airfield. Starkweather Creek is a tributary of Lake Monona. At one spot on the creek, concentrations of two specific compounds — PFOS and PFOA — measured 270 parts per trillion and 43 parts per trillion, respectively. In June, the state Department of Health Services recommended a cumulative enforcement standard in groundwater of 20 parts per trillion for the two compounds. The recommendation must go through a lengthy state rule-making process. There is no federal health standard. The DNR also found water samples of 23 parts per trillion for PFOA and 3.1 parts per trillion for PFOS below Rhinelander. Previously, PFAS was detected in public drinking water wells in the city of Rhinelander. Locations where the chemicals were found at lower levels were streams in Monroe County near the Fort McCoy military installation, multiple sites on the Mississippi River and in the Menominee River in Marinette. PFAS contamination is suspected at fire suppression training locations at Fort McCoy training center. The Mississippi is known to contain chemicals linked to 3M Corp. operations in Minnesota and other unconfirmed sources. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong style="margin -right:3px;">RELATED: </strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/wisconsin/2019/02/04/tyco-waited-4-years-disclose-toxins-wisconsin- drinking-wells/2727670002/" target="_blank">Johnson Controls unit Tyco knew since 2013 it was polluting wells.

While that process progresses, he said, the cleanup will continue.<br/><br/>“We felt it was urgent enough to spend public dollars now on the cleanup,” Kelly said Monday, “and then seek out cost recovery at a later date from those who left behind this mess. ”<br/><br/>The entire cleanup process is expected to take the next two or three weeks. The estimated cleanup costs, plus locating the former owner, will be $250,000.<br/><br/>The site is owned by Lenawee County and is in the city of Adrian, so both parties are fully aware of the project and the different measures being taken to ensure it’s done properly. <br/><br/>Kelly said the danger from the asbestos comes from it getting airborne. To prevent this from happening as it’s dug up, the piles are beings saturated with water to prevent dust. The EPA also brought in air monitoring devices and placed them at the site to make sure the work is not causing any issues. The piles are being hauled away to the EPA-certified and compliant drop site at the Carleton Farms Landfill, in Sumpter Township, near New Boston in Wayne County. <br/><br/>As far as cost recovery of the tax dollars being used, Kelly said they will not let up until the former owner and those who left the piles behind are held responsible.

 <p>ADRIAN — When Alice Mackey purchased her home in Adrian 23 years ago she thought she would live there until her dying days. <br><br> Her plan changed eight years ago when she was told by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality her property was contaminated with perchloroethylene, which is a colorless liquid widely used for dry cleaning of fabrics. <br/><br/>Now her goal is to get the word out on her home, knowing she may soon lose it to foreclosure and being a real estate agent she said the bank doesn’t necessarily have to disclose the property ’s condition.<br/><br/>“I want it known that it’s contaminated,” Mackey said. “If I didn’t care I could just rent it out, but I won’t because someone else might get sick.” <br/><br/>Her home is at 126 Greenly St. and for a long time there was a dry cleaning business behind her residence, which eventually closed up shop and moved it operations elsewhere. <br/><br/>Knowing the DEQ’s assessment , she said her ongoing health issues began making sense. For years, while living in the home, she experienced such ailments as various skin irritations and swollen eyes. Her health issues became more severe over the years and eventually she was diagnosed as having toxic chemical dermatitis.<br/><br/>The DEQ had a soil and gas interceptor installed, but her health did not improve and for a long time she was prescribed steroids.

 <p>ADRIAN — The state of Michigan is designating its section of Lake Erie as an impaired waterway because of damage to fish and other wildlife caused by harmful algal blooms, officials said Thursday.</p> ADRIAN — The state of Michigan is designating its section of Lake Erie as an impaired waterway because of damage to fish and other wildlife caused by harmful algal blooms, officials said Thursday. The declaration affects only the part of the lake under Michigan’s jurisdiction, which is less than 2 percent. But it was required under the federal Clean Water Act after shoreline monitoring and analysis of satellite imagery showed that the western Lake Erie basin was failing to meet Michigan water quality standards, said Heidi Grether, director of the state Department of Environmental Quality. “Michigan’s portion of Lake Erie is small but, in making this determination, we signal the importance of our actions to date and our commitment moving forward to limit the incidences of severe algal blooms that impact aquatic life and wildlife in our waters,” Grether told the Associated Press. Pam Taylor, a full-time volunteer with the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan, told The Daily Telegram in an email that Michigan went further than Ohio, which only declared certain sections of the Lake Erie coastline and the area around the Toledo water intake impaired. “Michigan has declared the open waters of the western Lake Erie basin impaired for phosphorus,” Taylor wrote. “This will eventually impact sources in all waterways draining into the Michigan portion of the western basin of Lake Erie, including the tributaries. This is a very big step in the right direction. Michigan did much better than Ohio, in this case.” Outbreaks of blue-green algae — which is actually a type of bacteria that can produce toxins — have plagued the lake since the 1990s, at times coating large sections in pea-green slime. Contamination in 2014 left more than 400,000 people in Toledo and parts of southeastern Michigan unable to drink tap water for two days. The 2015 bloom was the largest on record — covering an area the size of New York City. This year’s bloom was smaller because there were fewer storms that washed phosphorus-laden fertilizers into the lake. But toxicity levels were higher, according to scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Michigan, Ohio and the Canadian province of Ontario agreed in 2015 to seek a 40 percent cut in phosphorus runoff into the lake by 2015. They are developing plans to meet the goal, focusing primarily on preventing overflows from municipal sewage treatment plants and encouraging farmers to use practices that prevent manure and fertilizers from flowing into tributary rivers. A finding that a water body is impaired can lead to a federal order for stricter pollution controls. Such controls include a maximum amount of a contaminant that can exist in the water and regulation of industries and others that cause the pollution. But for now, Michigan officials are not developing such a plan, known as a “Total Maximum Daily Load” or TMDL blueprint. Instead, they will ask the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to give the agreement between the two states and Ontario time to work. “We are always looking for more collaborative, voluntary approaches to trying to solve these problems,” Grether said. She said using a TMDL would be “like taking a sledgehammer when you might need a pencil.” The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s campaign for voluntary farm measures — such as planting strips of vegetation between croplands and waterways to prevent erosion — is getting results, according to the agency’s director, Jamie Clover Adams. She credited that approach with a sharp drop of phosphorus levels in the River Raisin in southeastern Michigan, a Lake Erie tributary. “While it is true that River Raisin's total phosphorus levels have fallen, the amounts of a subset of total phosphorus called dissolved reactive phosphorus have more than doubled over the same time period,” Taylor said in her email. “It is dissolved reactive phosphorus, not total phosphorus, which feeds the cyanobacteria. Ms. Clover-Adams’ comments about total phosphorus in the Raisin, while true, have nothing to do with the cyanobacteria that produces the microcystin toxin.” Some scientists and environmental advocates contend farm programs won’t be enough to solve the algae problem unless all farms are required to participate. Still, Michigan’s impaired-water designation under the Clean Water Act is “a crucial and encouraging first step” because it makes a cleanup enforceable under federal law, said Mike Shriberg, Great Lakes regional executive director for the National Wildlife Federation. “Today’s action needs to be a catalyst for the U.S. EPA and states of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana to act with urgency to craft and implement a pollution-reduction plan that protects our waters from harmful algal blooms,” Shriberg said. A farm group said the designation was unnecessary and wouldn’t solve the algae problem. “Instead of encouraging constructive solutions, today’s announcement sets the table for even more government mandates, largely driven by fringe groups out to dismantle Michigan agriculture,” said Jim Byrum, president of the Michigan Agri-Business Association.

 A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention. <p>A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention.</p> A new study by Rochester Institute of Technology that inventories and tracks high concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes could help inform cleanup efforts and target pollution prevention. Researchers found that nearly 10,000 metric tons — or 22 million pounds — of plastic debris enter the Great Lakes every year from the United States and Canada. Matthew Hoffman, assistant professor in RIT’s School of Mathematical Sciences, is the lead author of “Inventory and Transport of Plastic Debris in the Laurentian Great Lakes,” which will run in an upcoming issue of Marine Pollution Bulletin. “This study is the first picture of the true scale of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes,” Hoffman said. Hoffman used computer simulations to follow the volume of plastic debris moving across state and international boundaries — from Illinois to Michigan and from Canada to the United States. Earlier studies estimate 40,000 to 110,000 metric tons of plastics enter the oceans along the U.S. coastline, he said. In their study, Hoffman and co-author Eric Hittinger, assistant professor of public policy at RIT, report that half of the plastic pollution entering the Great Lakes — 5,000 metrics tons a year — goes into Lake Michigan, followed by Lake Erie with 2,500 metric tons and Lake Ontario with 1,400 metric tons. Lake Huron receives 600 metric tons of plastic and Lake Superior, 32 metric tons a year. Estimates of surface microplastics entering the lakes each year show 4.41 metric tons in Lake Erie, 1.44 metric tons in Lake Huron and .0211 metric ton in Lake Superior. Plastic pollution in Lake Michigan is approximately the equivalent of 100 Olympic-sized pools full of plastic bottles dumped into the lake every year, Hittinger said, whereas the yearly amount of plastic in Lake Ontario equates to 28 Olympic-sized pools full of plastic bottles. Prior observational studies measured localized concentrations of plastic pollution in the open water, tributaries and along the shorelines. The new study applied mathematical modeling for the first time to extend the scope of the problem over time and spatial scales. The inventory gives full mass estimates on the entire connected lake system and maps plastic debris moving between lakes and across interstate and international borders. The results provide environmentally realistic concentrations of plastic in the Great Lakes. Findings of the study show debris travels differently in the Great Lakes than in the ocean. Instead of the floating “garbage patches” found in the ocean, plastic in the Great Lakes is carried by persistent winds and lake currents to the shore — often washing up in another state or country, Hoffman said. Plastic accounts for about 80 percent of the litter on the shorelines of the Great Lakes. The study quantifies dense plastic that quickly sinks and surface plastics like microbeads, fragments and pellets, plastic line and Styrofoam, which could be consumed by wildlife and potentially enter the food chain. Major population centers are the primary sources of plastic pollution in the Great Lakes system, with Chicago, Toronto, Cleveland and Detroit releasing more plastic particles than accumulate on their shorelines. “Most of the particles from Chicago and Milwaukee end up accumulating on the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, while the particles from Detroit and Cleveland end up along the southern coast of the eastern basin of Lake Erie,” Hoffman said. “Particles released from Toronto appear to accumulate on the southern coast of Lake Ontario, including around Rochester and Sodus Bay,” he said. Estimates of plastic pollution throughout the Great Lakes were derived using population dynamics within 62 miles of the shores and hydrodynamic modeling to simulate the distribution of plastic debris throughout the Great Lakes from 2009 to 2014. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Coastal Forecast System were used to simulate currents transporting plastic debris throughout the lake system.

 <p> CAMBRIDGE TWP. — A long-abandoned gas station at M-50 and U.S. 12 is being cleaned up.</p> CAMBRIDGE TWP. — A long-abandoned gas station at M-50 and U.S. 12 is being cleaned up. Heavy equipment recently was moved to Cambridge Junction and the former Darwin’s Marathon gas station and convenience store at 11535 W. U.S. 12, where crews have been digging up and removing underground storage tanks and other buried components. The owners of the property, Brooklyn U.S. 12 LLC, are based in Howell, according to Cambridge Township records. Cambridge Township clerk Rick Richardson said the cleanup project started years ago but came to a halt when the owners “ran out of money.” In December 2014, Gov. Rick Snyder signed Senate Bill No. 791 into law as Public Act 416, which provides funding for underground storage tank removal as part of environmental cleanup efforts. Richardson said state officials contacted the township in 2015 and said the cleanup work would be taking place again. No plans for the property have been publicized, Richardson said, although preliminary discussion was centered on constructing a new service station complex. Currently, the former station’s garage and store office remains standing.

The advisory only applies to the Luna Pier Beach public bathing area based on county sampling locations. On Tuesday, the city beach surface water sample results showed that levels of Escherichia coliform (E. coli) bacterial contamination exceeded acceptable standards, said Chris Westover, a registered environmental health specialist for the Monroe County Health Department. "Due to the poor water quality, the health department advises against public swimming and full body contact at Luna Pier City Beach until further notice," Westover said in a statement Wednesday. On Wednesday, health department personnel will re-sample water at the beach in hopes of lifting the advisory on Friday afternoon. The advisory against full-body contact remains in effect until future test water sample results indicate an acceptable level for body contact with the water. Detailed bathing beach sample results are available on the health department Web site at: http://www.co.monroe.mi.us/officials_and_departments/departments/health_department/environmental_health/ bathing_beaches.php For more information on the beach water sampling program, persons can contact Westover at 240-7921.

 The lab will test water samples near the city of Toledo daily and send the results to researchers who can sound the alarm if toxin levels rise. <p> On Aug. 2, 2014, the water became too dangerous to drink for more than 30,000 Monroe County residents.</p> On Aug. 2, 2014, the water became too dangerous to drink for more than 30,000 Monroe County residents. They spent the next two days traveling dozens of miles to find bottled water or getting it from municipalities until the water was declared safe Aug. 4. The cause: high levels of microcystin toxins created by an algal bloom on Lake Erie near the intake for the City of Toledo water system. The crisis hit customers of the South County Water System — Bedford and Erie Townships, the City of Luna Pier and part of LaSalle Township — which gets its water from Toledo. In all, more than 400,000 Toledo water customers were hit. Now, a new underwater research tool has been deployed in Lake Erie to safeguard the water system. Last week, a robotic lake-bottom laboratory began tracking the levels of dangerous toxins produced by cyanobacteria that bloom each summer in the lake’s western basin. The goal is to provide advance warning to municipal drinking water managers and thereby prevent a recurrence of the water crisis, said the Ann Arbor-based researchers involved in the project. The purchase of the $375,000 environmental sample processor (ESP) was a direct response to the Toledo event. It’s positioned at a spot on the lake bottom where it can provide about a day ’s notice if highly toxic water appears to be headed toward the city’s water intake. Tests will be done every other day initially, then increased to once a day starting Aug. 1 to coincide with the expected peak in bloom toxicity, they said. Test results are sent automatically to the researchers. “Our No. 1 goal is to protect water intakes and to prevent public exposure to these toxins,” said aquatic ecologist Tom Johengen, associate director of the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, in a press release. “If this device had been in place in the summer of 2014, it would have made a difference,” he said. The project is a collaboration among CIGLR, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) in Ann Arbor, NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. ESPniagara, the robotic lab, was bought with funds from the federal Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which also helps pay the operating costs. Two more ESPs will be deployed for testing in western Lake Erie next summer and should be in regular service in 2019, said Timothy Davis, a molecular ecologist at NOAA’s Ann Arbor lab and leader of the GLERL-CIGLR harmful algal bloom monitoring team, in the press release. Ultimately, toxicity data from the three autonomous labs will be incorporated into short-term algal bloom forecasts for the western Lake Erie basin. “Hopefully, we will never have an event like Toledo again, because we’ll be able to forecast bloom location, movement and toxicity with accuracy so that water treatment managers know when it’s coming and can be prepared,” Davis said. More than a dozen ESPs are in use globally, but ESPniagara is the first in the Great Lakes and the first to test for microcystins, a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria, said CIGLR. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms sometimes called blue-green algae. The Great Lakes are home to dozens of common cyanobacterial species, but only a few are toxic troublemakers. The Toledo water crisis was blamed on toxins produced by the common species Microcystis aeruginosa. The ESPniagara “lab in a can” was field-tested in western Lake Erie last fall. It was deployed for regular service July 11 and began routine toxin tests Tuesday, said CIGLR. It is located about four miles west of the Toledo municipal water intake at a depth of 18 feet. The intake is about 2½ miles offshore from Reno Beach, Ohio. It will remain there until mid-August, when it will be retrieved for routine maintenance, then returned to the lake in September and October. “The Toledo water crisis pushed the issue of Lake Erie’s harmful algal blooms into the spotlight and showed how impactful they can be to people’s daily lives — and potentially to human health — by affecting one of the basic resources that we need for life, which is clean drinking water,” Davis said.

 <p>ADRIAN — The section of the River Raisin between Merrick Street and Michigan Avenue always has been an issue.</p> ADRIAN — The section of the River Raisin between Merrick Street and Michigan Avenue always has been an issue. That part of the river has been a notorious clogging point because of downed trees, brush and trash, city of Adrian parks and forestry foreman Jason Lawrence said. “It’s always been a problem, but the work being done today and this weekend will hopefully help it to flow a lot better,” Lawrence said. A crew from Floyd’s Rigging & Machinery Movers of Adrian, along with one from Ropes and Rigging Tree Service of Onsted, joined city parks and forestry employees to do some of the heavy lifting leading up to the Adrian Noon Rotary’s cleanup event on Saturday. The work on Thursday was funded by a joint effort between the Rotary club and the city. “We really appreciate the help of the Noon Rotary Club,” Lawrence said. “It makes a difference.” Kyle Tillotson of Floyd ’s Rigging said they were using their hydraulic crane to lift out the downed trees from the river, which were being cut up by the city and Ropes and Rigging crews. He said there were at least three large trees blocking the flow, which then caused brush and trash to accumulate in that area. Another part of the project involved the old railroad bridge crossing the river at that point as well. Supports underneath the bridge also were causing debris buildup and clogging. Lawrence said the city had an engineer look at that area and it was determined that some supports could come down and the bridge still would be stable enough to hold a large vehicle. The Kiwanis Trail was closed in that area while the work was being done Thursday. The work was expected to take one day. “The goal is to increase the flow,” Lawrence said as the crane took up another log from the river and placed it into a waiting city truck to be hauled away. The cleanup event will be from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 9. Anyone can participate. Volunteers are being asked to meet at Riverside Park, 321 S. McKenzie St.

On 11:15 a.m. Monday, DTE officials discovered an oil sheen in a storm water outfall canal on plant property, said John Austerberry, manager of nuclear communications. The sheen was noticed by a plant technician who was performing a routine inspection. DTE Energy officials reported the incident to the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The oil, estimated to be about five to 10 gallons, was contained in the canal and is being removed by the contractor, Austerberry said. The oil was traced to a vent on the roof of the plant’s turbine building. The vent is designed to release oil vapor from the turbine’s lubricating system into a capture system. Storm water drains on the roof of the building carried the oil to the monitored outfall canal. “This incident will have no impact on the water quality in Lake Erie or Swan Creek,” Austerberry said. “This event will also have no impact on plant safety or plant operations, and the oil did not contain any radioactive material.” The outfall canal, which empties into Swan Creek, is regularly monitored, officials said. “Further investigation will be conducted to determine how the small quantity of oil bypassed the collection system,” Austerberry said.

 <p>ADRIAN — The Adrian Utilities Department released a statement Tuesday reporting again that although the city’s water continues to have taste and odor issues, it is safe to drink.</p> ADRIAN — The Adrian Utilities Department released a statement Tuesday reporting again that although the city’s water continues to have taste and odor issues, it is safe to drink. The issues with the city’s drinking water supply, which date back to mid-July, are due to the increased use of water from Lake Adrian. “Our current groundwater source (wells) cannot produce the volume of water necessary to meet our demands,” the statement read. Approximately 80 percent of the water going into the system is from groundwater sources. The balance is coming from Lake Adrian. As with any surface water, according to the statement, lakes are susceptible to runoff, organics and biological activity, including algae growth. “Our water treatment plant is a complete treatment facility…,” the statement said. “Plant operators conduct approximately 100 tests every day testing for hardness, alkalinity, pH, color, UV254 (a test to detect organic matter), temperature, calcium, fluoride, turbidity, chlorine, and bacteria.” Those tests are performed at an independent lab, city officials said in the statement. Microbiological tests for coliform and E. coli are performed daily at the water plant tap water as well as 25 samples per month throughout the city. “We have detected none of these at any of the sites,” the statement read. While the perception is that drinking water is bacteria free, officials said, “that is not the case.” “We do not sterilize the water. The water is disinfected, meaning that we apply chorine over a minimum amount of time to kill any harmful bacteria and provide a barrier against any infiltration from outside the system.” The added chlorine can cause problems in the system when combined with some organics such as algae. The result is the “earthy” taste and smells coming from the city water for the past several weeks. The statement read that city officials are doing tasks required by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to treat with additional chemicals specifically designed for treating organic material. That process may take a few weeks. The water situation was a topic of discussion Monday at both the city commission’s premeeting and regular meeting. Several people at the Adrian City Commission meeting Monday said the water taste and smell is problematic for personal use and businesses, whose products using water are being affected. Commissioner Lad Strayer said the water situation is “spotty.” “My water is not affected, but my neighbors have reported situations.” Mayor Chuck Jacobson said at the premeeting and during the regular meeting, prior to the statement’s release, that all water tests are “coming up fine.” Jacobson said the city is working on short- and long-term solutions. “It’s just the smell and taste that is the issue, but it’s also not acceptable to have water that smells and tastes like this, and (citywide) needs are only going to grow,” he said. All lab data is available upon request, city officials said. Those with questions may call Tim Ritchie or Will Sadler at 264-4820 or 264-4825, or email them at TRitchie@adrianmi.gov or WSadler@adrianmi.gov.

 Officials say state testing showed contaminant found in surface water but not in village's drinking water <p>DEERFIELD — Possible PFOS contamination was found at the intake of the Deerfield Water Filtration Plant, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.</p> DEERFIELD — Possible PFOS contamination was found at the intake of the Deerfield Water Filtration Plant, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy. EGLE notified state legislators and local officials Friday night that evidence of possible perfluorooctane sulfonic acids (PFOS) were found at the intake of the Deerfield plant. Monthly testing of surface water detected PFOS on July 29. However, drinking water treated at the plant showed no detections. The agency said there is no data suggesting drinking water has been compromised. PFOS are man-made chemicals used in industrial and consumer products such as carpet and clothing treatments as well as firefighting foams, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The chemicals can have potentially adverse effects on human health and the environment because of their toxicity. They are resistant to environmental degradation processes. Further testing upstream and downstream will continue. EGLE will also retest drinking water in Deerfield, Adrian, Blissfield, Frenchtown and Monroe. Those water systems were tested last year for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and showed no "significant contamination," according to a news release. Public water systems are tested by EGLE on a monthly basis. State legislators Rep. Bronna Kahle, R-Adrian, and Sen. Dale Zorn, R-Ida, both issued statements regarding EGLE's find and pledged to release more information when it becomes available. "Deerfield is fortunate to have a municipal water filtration system that removes such chemicals,” Zorn said in a statement. “However, municipal water plants upstream and downstream of the River Raisin should have an aggressive investigation to locate the cause. I will continue to monitor EGLE with daily briefings.” The state created the PFAS Action Response Team in 2017 to find and manage the presence of PFAS chemicals. Earlier this summer, Kahle was part of a bipartisan group of legislators that introduced reforms to the state's PFAS/PFOS testing and response system. “PFAS and PFOS contamination is still an emerging issue around Michigan, and state officials are still learning all they can,” Kahle said in a statement. “We have made progress in the last couple of years funding research surveys and advanced testing, and I am glad to see officials were able to find this contamination before it got into our drinking water. But today is a reminder there is no such thing as good enough. We can and will do more to find PFAS and PFOS in our area and protect local residents from these harmful chemicals.” Residents can contact Kahle at 517-373-1706 or by email at BronnaKahle@House. MI.gov and Zorn at 517-373-3543 or by email at SenDZorn@Senate. Michigan.gov. EGLE can be contacted 800-662-9278 or by email at EGLE-Assist@Michigan.gov.

 <p>LANSING — State officials say a lab error resulted in a false positive test for a contaminant in water outside the village of Deerfield's water filtration plant.</p> LANSING — State officials say a lab error resulted in a false positive test for a contaminant in water outside the village of Deerfield's water filtration plant. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) late Tuesday contacted state Sen. Dale Zorn, state Rep. Bronna Kahle, the village of Deerfield, and the Lenawee County Health Department to inform them that a high result in late August of PFOS contamination in surface water at the intake of the Deerfield Water Filtration Plant was due to a lab error at the Vista Labs facility in California. “I want to remind residents that the treated drinking water showed no evidence of PFOS, so there was never an issue to their water,” Zorn, R-Ida, said in a news release. “While the summer notification for area families was unfortunate, it is always best to be safe rather than sorry when it comes to our drinking water.” Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, can lead to adverse human health effects. Laboratory results received on Aug. 30 detected PFOS in a sample collected from EGLE’s monthly PFAS testing of the surface water at the intake to the Deerfield water plant. EGLE continues to test all public water systems with surface water intakes on a monthly basis, the release said. The department said it is currently collecting weekly samples from Deerfield, Blissfield, Frenchtown and Monroe and results will continue to be monitored. “All Michigan families should have access to clean drinking water,” Kahle, R-Adrian, said in the release. “Although the residents of Deerfield now have the peace of mind that their water is safe, I am going to continue working hard to get answers from the state about the situation and to pass important reforms to improve our PFOS and PFAS testing.” In 2017, the state created the Michigan PFAS Action Response Team (MPART), which is leading state efforts in finding and managing the presence of these chemicals in local water systems and the response to their discovery. For more information, including test results, visit www.mi.gov/PFASresponse. In June, Kahle was part of a bipartisan group of legislators introducing new reforms to Michigan’s PFAS/PFOS testing and response system. The groundwater quality package includes her bill, House Bill 4745, to deliver critical resources to the MPART effort and fund geological surveys that can find contamination before it enters municipal water systems. Zorn and Kahle highlighted that the budget approved by the Legislature on Tuesday includes Senate Bill 137, which features $120 million for drinking water protections, including funds to address PFAS and other emerging contaminants and for a new private well testing grant program.

 <p>MORENCI — A tractor fire in Morenci became more complex Sunday night it became a hazardous material cleanup operation.</p> MORENCI — A tractor fire in Morenci became more complex Sunday night it became a hazardous material cleanup operation. According to Morenci Fire Chief Brad Lonis, emergency personnel were dispatched to a tractor fire at around 8:20 p.m. on Medina Road, near the Morey Highway intersection. Lonis said that on arrival, they found a large tractor that was fully involved. “We’re pretty sure the cause of the fire was due to a ruptured fuel tank,” Lonis said, adding that a trail of fuel was seen coming from the area the tractor turned onto Medina Road from Morey Highway. The tractor was pulling a trailer full of silage, which also caught fire and had stopped underneath power lines. Firefighters called Consumers Energy to cut power to the lines while they fought the fire. The fire was put out after about five minutes, but the diesel fuel had leaked out into a ditch at the side of the road and the scene turned into a hazmat situation, with firefighters using absorbent materials on the spill and sandbags to contain it. “We carry a lot of backing material and booms in our special operations trailer, so we were able to get our booms and pillows down and I called the county for a truck-full of sand to build a dike on each side of the spill,” Lonis said. Firefighters were successful in preventing the spill from reaching the county drain at the intersection. A professional cleanup company was contacted by the tractor's owner. Lenawee County Emergency Management coordinator Craig Tanis, who was contacted by Lonis from the scene, said there was approximately 100 gallons of diesel fuel that spilled into the ditch. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) was also informed of the spill. Tanis said the cleanup would require the cleanup company to remove the soil where the spill occurred. “Whatever gets saturated into the ground, usually that dirt has to be totally removed and then hauled out to a landfill that will accept contaminated soil like that,” Tanis said. “It was one of them calls (where) you went from … a fire, then you had a potential electrical hazard, then … our gears switched over to a spill situation. So it was kind of a three-fold call there,” Lonis said. “The guys did a nice job handling and mitigating everything.”

 <p > The agriculture industry has found itself under more scrutiny as concerns grow over water quality and Lake Erie algae blooms. Some farmers are trying to be a part of the solution by participating in conservation practices while the state conducts further research into which ones make the most impact.</p > The agriculture industry has found itself under more scrutiny as concerns grow over water quality and Lake Erie algae blooms. Some farmers are trying to be a part of the solution by participating in conservation practices while the state conducts further research into which ones make the most impact. The Lenawee Conservation District sponsored a water quality forum Wednesday night at Siena Heights University that focused on agricultural water quality and what is being done to improve the quality of water in the Western Lake Erie Basin. Nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen are common fertilizers. They help produce better yields. However, these types of nutrients pose water quality problems when they leach into surface water. This has been seen in recent years when Lake Erie became contaminated with algae blooms, often time requiring people and pets to avoid contact with it. There is a conscientious effort to prevent these nutrients from leaving farm fields. These include voluntary programs that incentivize farmers to institute conservation practices on their farms. MAEAP-certified Tthe Michigan Agriculture Environmental Assurance Program (MAEAP, pronounced "meep") provides assistance for farmers by evaluating risks on their farm that may be detrimental to the environment. Joe Kelpinski, program manager for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, gave a primer on the program during the forum. There are three phases to MAEAP. The first involves assessing the farm directly, such as wells and fertilizers storage. Then there's evaluating farm fields and practices such as nutrient applications and erosion control. Livestock practices are also evaluated along with the forests and habitats around the farm. "The main thing they get out of it," Kelpinski said, "is the fact they have someone from the department of ag there that is evaluating their practices, what they're doing, looking at their records, doing record reviews and basically assuring them that they are, at the current time, meeting the best management practices we are aware of." If a farmer passes multiple different assessments they are then MAEAP-certified. Kelpinski said there are about 5,500 certifications in the state which adds up to between 2,900 and 3,200 individual farms. Lenawee and Monroe counties are the most active counties, according to Kelpinski. Between the two, he said there are between 350 and 380 certified farms. "It is widely considered across the county as the grandaddy of all volunteer farm programs, conservation programs, that have been successful," Kelpinski said. Putting it into practice Jacob Isley's farm is MAEAP certified. He was the farmer representative of the panel. The sixth-generation farmer in Palmyra said they were motivated to adopt more sustainable practices following 2012 when drought turned the soil into dust. "There's nothing to this," Isley remembered saying. Isley began soil sampling to determine the make up of the fields. "That allows us then to make a prescription application of any additional fertilizer we need to use," he said. "That helps us make sure we're not over-fertilizing or under-fertilizing ..." This transitioned into planting cover crops, usually varieties of rye grass. This helps keep more of the nutrients on the fields, he said. "If agriculture is part of what's causing some of the problems in the watershed, we also want to be a part of the solution," Isley said. "That was really some of the motivation for us." Strip tilling, the practice of only tilling areas where a planter will place seeds in the ground, is another practice Isley uses to prevent erosion. He has about six miles of filter strips — grass strips intended to catch runoff nutrients — along fields and ditches. Jessica D'Ambrosio, Ohio agriculture project director for The Nature Conservancy, called vegetation such as filter strips "nature's filter." "We're putting practices in place that will catch and trap those nutrients every part along the way on its pathway toward the lake so it eventually does not get there," she said. Don't forget about manure However, those practices are not effective when it comes to dissolved orthophosphates, according to Pam Taylor. Taylor, of the Environmentally Concerned Citizens of South Central Michigan, said grass and other natural filters cannot control dissolved orthophosphates which pass right through them. Taylor, who received an invite to the forum but did not take part Wednesday, spoke to The Daily Telegram Friday about phosphorous and other agricultural issues impacting water quality. Dissolved orthophosphates come from biological waste and chemical fertilizers. It feeds cyanobacteria which contributes to algae blooms. The watchdog group heavily monitors water quality and concentrated animal feeding operations in the area. Taylor cited a Heidelberg University study at water quality forum in May 2019 that found orthophosphate levels in the River Raisin have doubled in the past 20 years. Phil Argiroff, of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, gave a brief update about the health of the River Raisin during the forum Wednesday. He said between 2008 and 2016 there was a "substantial decrease" in total phosphorous, but there has been an uptick in the past two years. Taylor and ECCSCM argue the use of liquid manure applied to farm fields is a major contributor to the orthophosphate and algae bloom problems. Taylor said the use of water with manure reduces the solid content to between 6 and 8%. At that level, nutrients are hard to control. "It really doesn't matter what conservation practice you use (at that point)," she said. The group advocates for sustainable pasteur-raised animals, instead of the confined setup seen with many large farms in the county. It also pushes for dry composting manure. This is the traditional manure, mixed with straw, often spread with an old-fashioned manure spreader. Taylor calls it "nature's best fertilizer. " The conservation practices used by Isley to keep more nutrients on the field would be effective with dry manure, she added. "The wetter it is, you can't control (it)," she said. Manure and CAFOs were not explicit topics Wednesday night, besides a few questions from audience members. More research needed There's still more research to be done. There was a consensus among the panel Wednesday that there is no one lone conservation practice that will solve the phosphorous problem. Likely, it's a combination of many, applied depending on location, soil type and a number of other factors. Lynn Vaccaro, a coastal ecosystem specialist with the University of Michigan Water Center, said some conservation practices have shown the potential to be applied at a larger scale. "Often times it takes a few different conservation practices applied together to best address phosphorous runoff," said the final member of forum. "We don't know how long it takes to see the result at the end of the lake," added D'Ambrosio. "That's still an unknown. We don't know how long it takes and how many of the practices you need. That's existing science we have to gather." And not every acre in the Lake Erie basin has the same impact toward water quality. Kelpinski made the argument of targeting funding toward the most impactful acres. "I think as we begin to implement that we'll see a bigger bang for the buck than a shotgun approach where everybody comes in and tries to get something," he said.

"It’s still considered a women’s disease. Like a lot of people, I had no idea guys could ever get it. "<br/ >

	Some of these Marines, and Devereaux, appeared before Congress in September of 2010 to testify about what happened to them. It has taken many years, but the activism has paid off.<br/>
< br/>
	Congress voted approval of the Janey Ensminger Act -- also known as the Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act -- earlier this month. It guarantees health care for Marines and their families affected by the base's toxic tap water.<br/>
<br/> The Act reads, "… to furnish hospital care, medical services and nursing home care to veterans who were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, while the water was contaminated at Camp Lejeune, and for other purposes. "<br/ >

	After treatment at the Dana Carver Cancer Center -- a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation, and a year on Herceptin -- the news was not good.<br/>
< br/> "I took the Herceptin for a year, and three days before the end of my treatment, doctors found the cancer had spread to my spine, ribs and hip," says Devereaux. "The projected life expectancy for metastatic breast cancer is 2 1/2 years. I don’t plan to do the standard life expectancy. I’ve already lived for 3 1/2 years. "<br/ >
< br/> He has added clinical trials, alternative medicine and natural treatments to his standard medical treatment.<br/>
< br/> "I do juices and greens, massage, acupuncture and Reiki. I exercise, rest and eat well. I’ve taken colonics. You just want your body to get rid of toxins. When you’re first diagnosed, you feel like you’ve lost control. The one thing you can control is your attitude toward fighting the disease. I try anything that might work. "<br/ >
< br/> He spent 10 months in a clinical trial of a promising new drug called TDM-1.<br/>
< br/>
	"A lot of people I know are doing great on it," says Devereaux. "It worked for me for 10 months before it stopped working. As patients, we are fighting to get TDM-1 accepted for treatment of breast cancer. "<br/ > <br/>
	Devereaux is now on a new chemotherapy combination of Navelbine and Herceptin, and his body is trying to adjust to the change.

 Stopping short of a complete turnabout, President Donald Trump is expected Friday to announce a revised Cuba policy aimed at stopping the flow of U.S. cash to the country's military and security services while maintaining diplomatic relations and allowing U.S. airlines and cruise ships to continue service to the island. <p>Trump to announce plan to stop cash flow to Cuban military</p> Trump to announce plan to stop cash flow to Cuban military WASHINGTON — Stopping short of a complete turnabout , President Donald Trump is expected Friday to announce a revised Cuba policy aimed at stopping the flow of U.S. cash to the country's military and security services while maintaining diplomatic relations and allowing U.S. airlines and cruise ships to continue service to the island. In a speech Friday at a Miami theater associated with Cuban exiles, Trump will cast the policy moves as fulfillment of a promise he made during last year's presidential campaign to reverse then-President Barack Obama's diplomatic re-engagement with the island after decades of estrangement. Senior White House officials who briefed reporters Thursday on the coming announcement said Obama's overtures had enriched Cuba's military while repression increased on the island. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the policy before Trump announces it, despite the president's regular criticism of the use of anonymous sources. About 4,000 more US troops to go to Afghanistan WASHINGTON — The Pentagon will send almost 4,000 additional American forces to Afghanistan, a Trump administration official said Thursday, hoping to break a stalemate in a war that has now passed to a third U.S. commander in chief. The deployment will be the largest of American manpower under Donald Trump's young presidency. The decision by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis could be announced as early as next week, the official said. It follows Trump's move to give Mattis the authority to set troop levels and seeks to address assertions by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan that he doesn't have enough forces to help Afghanistan's army against a resurgent Taliban insurgency. The rising threat posed by Islamic State extremists, evidenced in a rash of deadly attacks in the capital city of Kabul, has only fueled calls for a stronger U.S. presence, as have several recent American combat deaths. The bulk of the additional troops will train and advise Afghan forces, according to the administration official, who wasn't authorized to discuss details of the decision publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. A smaller number would be assigned to counterterror operations against the Taliban and IS, the official said. Doctors call Scalise's condition improved WASHINGTON — Doctors say the Louisiana congressman wounded during Wednesday's attack by a gunman on a baseball practice session remains in critical condition but has shown improvement. MedStar Washington Hospital Center says Rep. Steve Scalise, who was shot in the left hip, had surgery Thursday related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg. The hospital says Scalise "will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time." Scalise was fielding ground balls at second base when he was shot at a practice for the annual Republicans-Democrats baseball game. The wound shattered bones, tore organs and caused severe bleeding. Suspect identified in China kindergarten explosion; 8 killed BEIJING — Police have identified a suspect in an explosion at the front gate of a kindergarten in eastern China that killed eight and struck as relatives gathered to pick up their children at the end of the day, local authorities said Friday. Police were investigating the explosion as a criminal act and said they had "targeted" a suspect, according to a statement issued by authorities in the city of Xuzhou and the official Xinhua News Agency. It was unclear if the suspect was apprehended and no potential motive was provided. A witness cited by state media said a gas cylinder at a roadside food stall had caused the blast. Two people died at the scene and six died after being taken to a hospital following the explosion at 4:50 p.m. Thursday at the Chuangxin Kindergarten in Fengxian. Chemical company polluting Cape Fear since 1980 WILMINGTON, N.C. — A former DuPont plant has been discharging an unregulated toxic chemical into the Cape Fear River since 1980, company officials revealed Thursday at a meeting with local and state officials. The revelation came during the same meeting where officials from DuPont-spinoff Chemours Co. admitted the GenX found in some North Carolina public water supplies is likely coming from the Fayetteville Works site, about 100 miles up the Cape Fear River from Wilmington. Chemours wouldn’t commit to immediately stopping the discharge, although company officials did say they are exploring several avenues -- including tweaking the manufacturing process they believe is resulting in the GenX found in the Cape Fear. The company demurred when pressed to stop that process until they are certain the chemical is no longer leaking into the river. “We are asking this company to cease discharging this toxin into our water until we get more answers,” said Frank Williams, the chairman of Brunswick County Commissioners. “At this point, we don’t have answers.” For more on this story, click here.

 They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere. <p>LOWELL, Mass. — They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere.</p> LOWELL, Mass. — They hide in weeds along hiking trails and in playground grass. They wash into rivers and float downstream to land on beaches. They pepper baseball dugouts, sidewalks and streets. Syringes left by drug users amid the heroin crisis are turning up everywhere. In Portland, Maine, officials have collected more than 700 needles so far this year, putting them on track to handily exceed the nearly 900 gathered in all of 2016. In March alone, San Francisco collected more than 13,000 syringes, compared with only about 2,900 the same month in 2016. People, often children, risk getting stuck by discarded needles, raising the prospect they could contract blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or HIV or be exposed to remnants of heroin or other drugs. It's unclear whether anyone has gotten sick, but the reports of children finding the needles can be sickening in their own right. One 6-year-old girl in California mistook a discarded syringe for a thermometer and put it in her mouth; she was unharmed. "I just want more awareness that this is happening," said Nancy Holmes, whose 11-year-old daughter stepped on a needle in Santa Cruz, California, while swimming. "You would hear stories about finding needles at the beach or being poked at the beach. But you think that it wouldn't happen to you. Sure enough." They are a growing problem in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, two states that have seen many overdose deaths in recent years. "We would certainly characterize this as a health hazard," said Tim Soucy, health director in Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city, which collected 570 needles in 2016, the first year it began tracking the problem. It has found 247 needles so far this year. Needles turn up in places like parks, baseball diamonds, trails and beaches — isolated spots where drug users can gather and attract little attention, and often the same spots used by the public for recreation. The needles are tossed out of carelessness or the fear of being prosecuted for possessing them. One child was poked by a needle left on the grounds of a Utah elementary school. Another youngster stepped on one while playing on a beach in New Hampshire. Even if adults or children don't get sick, they still must endure an unsettling battery of tests to make sure they didn't catch anything. The girl who put a syringe in her mouth was not poked but had to be tested for hepatitis B and C, her mother said. Some community advocates are trying to sweep up the pollution. Rocky Morrison leads a cleanup effort along the Merrimack River, which winds through the old milling city of Lowell, and has recovered hundreds of needles in abandoned homeless camps that dot the banks, as well as in piles of debris that collect in floating booms he recently started setting. He has a collection of several hundred needles in a fishbowl, a prop he uses to illustrate that the problem is real and that towns must do more to combat it. "We started seeing it last year here and there. But now, it's just raining needles everywhere we go," said Morrison, a burly, tattooed construction worker whose Clean River Project has six boats working parts of the 117-mile (188-kilometer) river. Among the oldest tracking programs is in Santa Cruz, California, where the community group Take Back Santa Cruz has reported finding more than 14,500 needles in the county over the past 4 1/2 years. It says it has gotten reports of 12 people getting stuck, half of them children. "It's become pretty commonplace to find them. We call it a rite of passage for a child to find their first needle," said Gabrielle Korte, a member of the group's needle team. "It's very depressing. It's infuriating. It's just gross." Some experts say the problem will ease only when more users get treatment and more funding is directed to treatment programs. Others are counting on needle exchange programs, now present in more than 30 states, or the creation of safe spaces to shoot up — already introduced in Canada and proposed by U.S. state and city officials from New York to Seattle. Studies have found that needle exchange programs can reduce pollution, said Don Des Jarlais, a researcher at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai hospital in New York. But Morrison and Korte complain poor supervision at needle exchanges will simply put more syringes in the hands of people who may not dispose of them properly. After complaints of discarded needles, Santa Cruz County took over its exchange from a nonprofit in 2013 and implemented changes. It did away with mobile exchanges and stopped allowing drug users to get needles without turning in an equal number of used ones, said Jason Hoppin, a spokesman for the Santa Cruz County. Along the Merrimack, nearly three dozen riverfront towns are debating how to stem the flow of needles. Two regional planning commissions are drafting a request for proposals for a cleanup plan. They hope to have it ready by the end of July. "We are all trying to get a grip on the problem," said Haverhill Mayor James Fiorentini. "The stuff comes from somewhere. If we can work together to stop it at the source, I am all for it."

 Study: Environmental pollution, including air, water and soil, kills 9 million people a year and costs $4.6 trillion <p>NEW DELHI — Environmental pollution — from filthy air to contaminated water — is killing more people every year than all war and violence in the world. More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.</p> NEW DELHI — Environmental pollution — from filthy air to contaminated water — is killing more people every year than all war and violence in the world. More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. One out of every six premature deaths in the world in 2015 — about 9 million — could be attributed to disease from toxic exposure, according to a major study released Thursday in the Lancet medical journal. The financial cost from pollution-related death, sickness and welfare is equally massive, the report says, costing some $4.6 trillion in annual losses — or about 6.2 percent of the global economy. "There's been a lot of study of pollution, but it's never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or climate change," said epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and the lead author of the report. The report marks the first attempt to pull together data on disease and death caused by all forms of pollution combined. "Pollution is a massive problem that people aren't seeing because they're looking at scattered bits of it," Landrigan said. Experts say the 9 million premature deaths the study found was just a partial estimate, and the number of people killed by pollution is undoubtedly higher and will be quantified once more research is done and new methods of assessing harmful impacts are developed. Areas like Sub-Saharan Africa have yet to even set up air pollution monitoring systems. Soil pollution has received scant attention. And there are still plenty of potential toxins still being ignored, with less than half of the 5,000 new chemicals widely dispersed throughout the environment since 1950 having been tested for safety or toxicity. "In the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background" just as industry began booming in developing nations, said Richard Fuller, head of the global toxic watchdog Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists, policy makers and public health experts who contributed to the 51-page report. "To some extent these countries look to the West for examples and discussion, and we'd dropped it," Fuller said. Asia and Africa are the regions putting the most people at risk, the study found, while India tops the list of individual countries. One out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5 million, was attributed to pollution. China's environment was the second deadliest, with more than 1.8 million premature deaths, or one in five, blamed on pollution-related illness, the study found. Several other countries such Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti also see nearly a fifth of their premature deaths caused by pollution. Still, many poorer countries have yet to make pollution control a priority, experts say. India has taken some recent actions, such as tightening vehicle and factory emission standards and occasionally limiting the number of cars on New Delhi's roads. But they have done little about crop burning, garbage fires, construction dust or rampant use of the dirtiest fossil fuels. A court ban on firework sales before the Diwali festival didn't stop New Delhi residents from firing rockets and lighting crackers throughout Thursday night. They awoke Friday morning to acrid, smoke-filled skies and levels of dangerous, lung-clogging particulate matter known as PM2.5 that went beyond 900 parts per million — 90 times the recommended limit by the World Health Organization, and 22 times higher than India's own limits. "Even though better pollution norms are coming in, still the pollution levels are continuously increasing," said Shambhavi Shukla, a research associate with the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, which was not involved in the Lancet study. To reach its figures on the overall global pollution burden, the study's authors used methods outlined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, as well as with air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study run by institutions including the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Even the conservative estimate of 9 million pollution-related deaths is one-and-a-half times higher than the number of people killed by smoking, three times the number killed by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, more than six times the number killed in road accidents, and 15 times the number killed in war or other forms of violence, according to GBD tallies. It is most often the world's poorest who suffer, the study found. The vast majority of pollution-related deaths — 92 percent — occur in low- or middle-income countries, where policy makers are chiefly concerned with developing their economies, lifting people out of poverty and building basic infrastructure. Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels. In wealthier countries where overall pollution is not as rampant, it is still the poorest communities that are more often exposed, the report says. "What people don't realize is that pollution does damage to economies. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after" — which is also costly, Fuller said. "There is this myth that finance ministers still live by, that you have to let industry pollute or else you won't develop," he said. "It just isn't true." The report cites EPA research showing that the U.S. has gained some $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on controlling air pollution since 1970, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, one of the world's most ambitious environmental laws. Removing lead from gasoline has earned the U.S. economy another $6 trillion cumulatively since 1980, according to studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some experts cautioned, however, that the report's economic message was murky. Reducing the pollution quantified in the report might impact production, and so would not likely translate into gains equal to the $4.6 trillion in economic losses. The report "highlights the social and economic justice of this issue," said Marc Jeuland, associate professor with the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University, who was not involved in the study. Without more concrete evidence for how specific policies might lead to economic gains, "policy makers will often find it difficult to take action, and this report thus only goes part way in making the case for action," he said. Jeuland also noted that, while the report counts mortality by each pollutant, there are possible overlaps — for example, someone exposed to both air pollution and water contamination — and actions to address one pollutant may not reduce mortality. "People should be careful not to extrapolate from the U.S. numbers on net (economic) benefits, because the net effects of pollution control will not be equivalent across locations," he said. The study's conclusions on the economic cost of pollution measure lost productivity and health care costs, while also considering studies measuring people's "willingness to pay" to reduce the probability of dying. While these types of studies yield estimates at best, they are used by many governments and economists trying to understand how societies value individual lives. While there has never been an international declaration on pollution, the topic is gaining traction. The World Bank in April declared that reducing pollution, in all forms, would now be a global priority. And in December, the United Nations will host its first pollution conference. "The relationship between pollution and poverty is very clear," said Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, lead environmental specialist at the World Bank. " And controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to malnutrition. The linkages can't be ignored."

 <p>PARIS — The rector of Notre Dame Cathedral says the Paris landmark is still so fragile that there's a "50% chance" the structure might not be saved, because scaffolding installed before this year's fire is threatening the vaults of the Gothic monument.</p> PARIS — The rector of Notre Dame Cathedral says the Paris landmark is still so fragile that there's a "50% chance" the structure might not be saved, because scaffolding installed before this year's fire is threatening the vaults of the Gothic monument. Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said restoration work isn't likely to begin until 2021 — and described his "heartache" that Notre Dame couldn't hold Christmas services this year, for the first time since the French Revolution. "Today it is not out of danger," he told The Associated Press on the sidelines of Christmas Eve midnight Mass in a nearby church. "It will be out of danger when we take out the remaining scaffolding." "Today we can say that there is maybe a 50% chance that it will be saved. There is also 50% chance of scaffolding falling onto the three vaults, so as you can see the building is still very fragile," he said. The 12th-century cathedral was under renovation at the time of the accidental April fire, which destroyed its roof and collapsed its spire. With no more roof to keep the massive stone structure stable, the cathedral's surviving vaults are crucial to keeping it standing, but they are vulnerable. Some 50,000 tubes of scaffolding crisscrossed the back of the edifice at the time of the fire, and some were damaged. Removing them without causing further problems is one of the toughest parts of the cleanup effort. "We need to remove completely the scaffolding in order to make the building safe, so in 2021 we will probably start the restoration of the cathedral," Chauvet said. "Once the scaffolding is removed we need to assess the state of the cathedral, the quantity of stones to be removed and replaced." Chauvet estimated it would take another three years after that to make it safe enough for people to re-enter the cathedral, but that the full restoration will take longer. President Emmanuel Macron has said he wants it rebuilt by 2024, when Paris hosts the Olympics, but experts have questioned whether that time frame is realistic. Another reason it's still too dangerous to host religious services inside Notre Dame: The fire released tons of toxic lead dust, and authorities are working to clean it up and assess related health risks. Notre Dame's symbolism reaches far and wide. Church officials estimated 2 million people from around the world visited the cathedral during the holiday season. Tourists can photograph it from nearby embankments, but they can no longer hear its organs or get a close view of its stone carvings and masterpiece rose windows. The vast forecourt is barricaded, barren of its Christmas tree. But its congregation, clergy and choir are keeping its spirit alive, and decamped Christmas celebrations to the Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois Church across from the Louvre Museum instead. Parishioners shared sorrow about the fire, but also a feeling of solidarity. "I remember my mother told me that she was watching TV, and that there was a fire at Notre Dame. I told her 'it's not possible,' and I took my bike, and when I arrived I was crying," said Jean-Luc Bodam, a Parisian engineer who used to cross town to attend services at the cathedral. "We are French, we are going to try to rebuild Notre Dame as it was before, because it is a symbol," he said.

 <p>ALMATY, Kazakhstan — A jetliner with 98 people aboard struggled to get airborne and crashed shortly after takeoff Friday in Kazakhstan, killing at least 12 people , authorities said.</p> ALMATY, Kazakhstan — A jetliner with 98 people aboard struggled to get airborne and crashed shortly after takeoff Friday in Kazakhstan, killing at least 12 people, authorities said. The Bek Air jet, identified as a 23-year-old Fokker 100, hit a concrete wall and a two-story building soon after departing from Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city and former capital, airport officials said. The aircraft's tail also struck the runway twice during takeoff, indicating that it struggled to get off the ground, Deputy Prime Minister Roman Sklyar said. Fifty-four people people were reported hospitalized with injuries, at least 10 of them in critical condition, officials said. The cause of the predawn crash was unclear. Authorities quickly suspended all Bek Air and Fokker 100 flights in Kazakhstan while the investigation got underway. One survivor said the plane started shaking less than two minutes after takeoff. "At first, the left wing jolted really hard, then the right. The plane continued to gain altitude, shaking quite severely, and then went down," Aslan Nazaraliyev told The Associated Press by phone. Government officials said the jet underwent de-icing before the flight, but Nazaraliyev recalled that its wings were covered in ice, and passengers who used emergency exits over the wings slipped and fell. The weather in Almaty was clear, with temperatures just below freezing. The plane was flying to Nur-Sultan, the capital formerly known as Astana. Video footage showed the front of the broken-up fuselage rammed against a building and the rear of the plane lying in a field next to the airport. Passengers who survived may have been saved by the fact that the plane crashed at a lower speed and from a lower altitude because it was taking off, and it came down in terrain that may have eased the impact. "The lower the speed, the lower the energy, and the fact that it lands on things that might not tear it up so much" all play a role, said Adrian Young, senior aviation consultant at the To70 consultancy in the Netherlands. Cold weather may have helped prevent fire, Young said. The plane built in 1996 included safety features that have increased passenger survival chances since the mid-1980s. Those features include stronger cabins less likely to crush or break apart and interior materials less apt to catch fire or emit toxic smoke. "The more modern the aircraft you are sitting in, the better chance you have of escaping the accident," Young said. Local authorities initially put the death toll at 15, but the interior ministry later revised the figure downward. Officials in the Almaty branch of the health ministry could not explain why the figure was revised. They attributed the confusion to "agitation" at the site of the crash. In a statement on its Facebook page, the airport said there was no fire, and a rescue operation began immediately. Around 1,000 people were working at the snow-covered crash site. Dozens more in Almaty lined up at a local blood bank to donate for the injured. The government promised to pay families of the dead around $10,000 each. The Fokker 100 is a mid-sized, twin-engine jet. The company that manufactured it went bankrupt in 1996, and production stopped the following year. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev ordered an inspection of all airlines and aviation infrastructure in the country. Eighteen passenger airlines and four cargo carriers are currently registered in Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic. Kazakhstan's air-safety record is far from spotless. In 2009, all Kazakh airlines — with the exception of the flagship carrier Air Astana — were banned from operating in the European Union because they did not meet international safety standards. The ban was lifted in 2016. _ _ _ Litvinova reported from Moscow. Associated Press Writer David McHugh contributed from Frankfurt, Germany.

 An in-depth look at the end of the nuclear power industry as we know it, and what lies ahead for the communities where plants are powering down. Holtec International, the company hired to tear down the Indian Point nuclear power plant, will present its demolition plans at a meeting tonight in Buchanan. Holtec is slated to appear at the second meeting of the Indian Point Nuclear Decommissioning Citizen Advisory Panel. The meeting begins at 6 p.m. at Village Hall in Buchanan.

The second, Unit 3, will be shut down in 2021, after which Holtec hopes to begin dismantling and demolishing the plant, which sits on 240 acres along the Hudson River in Buchanan. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) will need to sign off on Holtec's plan before the company moves ahead. New Jersey-based Holtec says it will take 12 to 15 years to tear down the 60-year-old power plant at a cost of $2.3 billion, money that will come out of a decommissioning trust fund overseen by Indian Point’s current owner, Entergy. Holtec plans to demolish the plant’s Unit 3 reactor in 2027 and Unit 2 two years later. Unit 1, which was shut down in 1974, will be demolished by 2032. Holtec told the NRC in December that it is considering a plan to remove large chunks of the plant by barges that will course down the Hudson River. The environmental group Riverkeeper has voiced its concern that radioactive material could spill into the river if barges are used.

 A tanker truck crashed off Tinker Hill Road and landed in a yard on Peekskill Hollow Road in Putnam Valley Aug. 19, 2019. PUTNAM VALLEY - A tanker truck that crashed into a tree in the area of Peekskill Hollow Road Monday afternoon  spilled about 3,300 gallons of liquid asphalt material into a stream that feeds into a source of drinking water for Peekskill. The driver, who was treated for a possible broken foot or leg, told police he lost his air and breaks and couldn't stop while he was driving toward a job site off of Barger Street, according to the Putnam County Sheriff's Office. The driver, a 34-year-old Amsterdam, New York, resident, lost control of the tanker, which crossed over the intersection of Tinker Hill and Peeksill Hollow roads, went through the guardrail and into a stream, then smashed into two trees, the sheriff's office said. The asphalt material poured out into a stream that feeds into the Peekskill Hollow Creek. Putnam Valley Town Supervisor Sam Oliverio said, "It's incredibly frightening," Oliverio said. New York state's Department of Environmental Conservation took control of the crash site, has crews working around the clock, and has hired on an environmental consultant to help test the water supply. Something that Oliverio thinks will take some time. "We don't have a municipal water supply like Peekskill, but there's a lot of people who'll need their wells tested along Tinker Hill Road," Oliverio said. The DEC officials provided the following statement: "Town of Putnam Valley Water Department officials promptly shut off all intake pumps after learning of the accident. A pump station in the creek located approximately 6 miles downstream from the spill site remains turned off. The water treatment plant is currently drawing directly from the reservoir. "Peekskill water department staff are at the pump station monitoring water quality in the stream. The city of Peekskill has enough raw/finished water storage to last several days, as well as an alternative source if the issue persists longer than storage limits allow. DEC will continue to work closely with local officials and emergency response personnel to ensure public health and the environment are protected." New York State Environmental Police look over the tanker truck that crashed off Peekskill Hollow Road at the bottom of Tinker Hill Road Aug. 19, 2019. The driver was injured and the truck leaked a large amount of it's contents which is used for asphalt work. Westchester and Putnam hazmat teams were called into to help with cleanup. As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, Oliverio said there was a crew of 15 people working on the cleanup effort. The tanker was overweight for operation on Tinker Hill Road, which violated local Putnam Valley code, according to the sheriff's office. The driver was issue an appearance ticket for the local law violation as well as vehicle and traffic violations of operating a vehicle over posted weight on a public highway, failure to obey a traffic control device and failure to stop at a stop sign. A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. This wasn't the first truck to crash on the road. The steep pitch has claimed five others in recent years. And while the DEC is still investigating the cause of the incident, Oliverio wants to change the hill to a one-way road. It's already supposed to be off-limits to trucks. "We've had a cement, lumber, garbage and car carriers all lose their brakes on the hill," Oliverio said. <em> The Journal News Reporters Chris Eberhart and Frank Esposito contributed to this story. </em>

 Weather in White Plains and the Lower Hudson Valley this week. High temperatures, humidity and elevated exposure to ozone have called for both a heat advisory and air quality advisory to be issued today in Rockland and Westchester, as well as much of the Northeast. The heat index will be around 95 degrees, though it will feel hotter. Heat advisories are issued when the combination of heat and humidity are expected to make it feel like it is 95 to 99 degrees for two or more consecutive days, or 100 to 104 degrees for any length of time. The state Department of Environmental Conservation's air quality health advisory is in effect until 11 p.m. tonight. AccuWeather forecast for July 30, 2019 Levels of outdoor pollution, either ozone or fine particulate matter, are expected to exceed national air quality standards, and be unhealthy for sensitive groups. This advisory is concerning ozone, which residents need to be aware of. "Ozone levels are usually highest after noon and through early evening hours on hot, sunny days, and therefore this part of the day is the peak time for symptoms," Rockland County Health Commissioner Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said. It's recommended that residents limit strenuous outdoor physical activity, such as jogging, ball-playing and running during the afternoon and early evening hours when ozone levels are the highest and when heat advisories are in place. Young children, the elderly, people with pre-existing lung disease such as asthma and people with pre-existing heart disease or high blood pressure may be more sensitive to ozone exposure than others. The Department of Health recommends that those who may be affected remain in an air-conditioned location. The most common symptom is a feeling of irritation in the eyes, nose and throat. Some experiencing exposure to elevated levels of ozone may also suffer shortness of breath, chest pain and wheezing. Some may also experience these effects as "feeling tired" or "lacking energy." The Rockland County Department of Health says if individuals are experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain or coughing that they should consult their doctor or seek medical attention immediately. <strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://twitter.com/ijkeane" target="_blank">Twitter:</a></strong>

 ORANGEBURG — The controversial plastics plant that for years has been accused of stinking up the neighborhood could be forced to pay $100,000 in fines after being found guilty of violating town code. API Industries, better known as Aluf Plastics, which operates a plant on Glenshaw Street, was found guilty Thursday  by Town Judge Richard Finning of releasing emissions above the town's threshold on five separate occasions in late 2018. The dates were Nov. 20 and Dec. 4, 5, 12 and 13, 2018, The owners of the property and corporate officers in their individual capacities were found not guilty. The violations carry maximum penalties of $20,000 each, putting the plastic bag manufacturer on the line for fines of up to $100,000 when Finning pronounces sentencing on Nov. 26. Aluf has been the target of complaints from residents and town officials for years over noxious smells that have plagued the neighborhood. The company and town officials have sparred at meetings and in court over neighbors' complaints and town testing over what has been described as everything from chemical odors to an almost floral smell. The company has argued that it was not the source of any odors wafting beyond its property line. Representatives from Aluf and its defense attorneys did not immediately return calls or emails for comment Friday afternoon. Residents rally outside of Aluf Plastics on March 5. During the trial before Finning, testimony for the town came from town officials and residents — including one resident who is also an environmental scientist. An employee of the company testified for the defense. Town Supervisor Chris Day said the verdict marked the first time a court of law had ruled Aluf was responsible and that the odors are at a nuisance level, which would help Orangetown in defending the lawsuits the company has filed against the town. Aluf Plastics in Orangeburg on Dec. 21, 2016. Local residents and the town has been complaining about odors coming from the plant. "That changes the ballgame in terms of ensuring compliance going forward," he said. Deputy town attorney Barbara Gionta prosecuted the case. The town has previously revised its code in terms of regulating odor; started an online odor reporting system to track complaints; completed a study which helped determine that Aluf was not in compliance with performance standards for their equipment and odor emission; and hired a public health engineer. <span class="exclude-from-newsgate"><strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/rockland/orangetown/2018/05/03/orangetown-aluf-testing-shows-nuisance-odors-coming-plant/570602002/" target="_blank">ORANGETOWN: </a></strong><a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="/story/news/local/rockland/orangetown/2018/05/03/orangetown-aluf-testing-shows-nuisance-odors-coming-plant/570602002/" target="_blank">Testing traces odors coming from Aluf plant</a></span> <em > Twitter: <a data-track-label="inline|intext|n/a" href="https://twitter.com/Bee_Bob" target="_blank">@Bee_bob</a></em>

 RAMAPO – Tests found traces of Legionella bacteria can cause a serious type of pneumonia called Legionnaires’ disease. Routine water tests find legionella at the Pine Valley Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Hillcrest Nov. 4, 2019. The Pine Valley administrator Yehudah Serle said Legionella disease was detected during yearly testing of the facility's water quality. The facility cares for older people with physical disabilities and people undergoing rehabilitation. "Firstly, I would like to clarify that there have been no patients that tested positive for Legionella disease here at Pine Valley," Surle said. A minority of water samples came back with a low level, but none of the tests came back positive for the most common form found in humans, called "l.pneumophila," he said. Surle said l.pneumophila is the strand most commonly found in humans and has been associated with all recently reported cases. "We test many samples, of which all have come back negative to this point," Surle said. "Nevertheless, our water management plan requires that precautionary measures be put into place irrespective of the type of strand." Surle said the facility has been working closely with the state Department of Health regarding all followup measures. As a precaution, all residents showing any respiratory signs or symptoms have been tested for Legionella and the facility is awaiting the results, he said. The Rockland Health Department confirmed there were no human cases, said John Lyon, a county spokesman. The department doesn't have oversight on such facilities unless water cooling towers are involved, like one that occurred in Orangetown several years ago, Lyon said. Lyon said the state Department of Health is overseeing Pine Valley. State Health Department spokeswoman Erin Silk said Pine Valley notified the agency on Oct.  31 about the Legionella environmental culture. She said there have been no reports of human cases of Legionellosis at this facility. "The facility has taken disinfection steps as required by existing regulation and voluntarily implemented precautions, which include use of bottled water and filters on showers," she said. "Follow-up testing will occur after at least seven days, but not more than 28 days, post disinfection. A relative of one Pine Valley resident expressed concern about her mother and feels management downplayed the test results. She said the results were not shared with families and much of the staff. She said the management put up a notice with small print informing people about the contaminated tap water. Her mother's dentures were soaking in tap water that had been tested. Surle said "resident and staff safety is our utmost priority and we will take all measures necessary." Rockland County dealt with Legionnaires' disease cases during the summer of 2015 after an outbreak in New York City. Legionnaires' disease or Legionellosis is not spread from person to person. People only get sick by breathing in water vapor containing bacteria, such as inhaling contaminated mist from faucets, showers, whirlpools or cooling towers, Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said in a 2015 news release. People who are sick with Legionella cannot make others sick, she said. Most healthy people do not become infected with Legionella bacteria after exposure, she said. People at higher risk of getting sick are those 50 years of age or older, current or former smokers, those with a chronic lung disease, those with a weak immune system from diseases like cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure, and people who take drugs that weaken one's immune system, like after a transplant operation or from chemotherapy.

 Caption Close ALBANY — The state will be digging out an underground plume of potentially carcinogenic chemicals beneath a former Washington Avenue dry cleaners near several homes routinely rented to college students. Plans by the Department of Environmental Conservation call for a $120,000 cleanup at the former site of RKO Cleaners, at 566 Washington Ave., to deal with unsafe levels of the industrial cleaning solvent tetrachloroethylene (PCE, also known as PERC). The chemical was found in the ground, groundwater and in vapors coming out of the ground. PERC is listed as a potential carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The DEC cleanup plan also calls for the underground injection of chemicals designed to degrade any remaining PERC. Work is expected to start this summer and last about two months as about 180 cubic yards (about 18 dump truck loads) of tainted soil are removed for disposal elsewhere. Parts of the site contain PERC at 100 times the level considered safe for residential use. The property was run as a dry cleaners from 1964 to 2000, when it was destroyed by a fire that caused some drums of cleaning chemicals to leak into the ground. The building was later demolished so tests of the polluted ground could be made, and the site was added to the state Superfund pollution cleanup program in 2013. The work will be paid for by state taxpayers, as the last known owners of the property could not be located, according to DEC. While there are unsafe PERC levels in the ground and groundwater beneath the site, the pollution "does not pose a threat to human health and environment," according to a February 2017 environmental report by consultants Henning, Durham & Richardson. There are residences just to the east of the building, some of which are rented for student housing, and the Abbott Tavern, a popular collegiate nightspot, to the south. The buildings were tested for the presence of potential PERC vapors. Those tests found inside air in those buildings was safe. One building had a system installed to collect any vapors and vent them outside. The property owners, identified on DEC paperwork at Louis Lettsome Sr., of Teaneck, N.J., and Sekyung Jeon, of Hartford, Ct., are currently delinquent on more than $152,000 in city, school and county property taxes, as well as interest and penalties, since 2001, according to Albany County. The county has initiated tax foreclosure proceedings, but has refused to take formal ownership for fear of being stuck with the cleanup bill. "The ultimate goal is to remediate this site for residential use, consistent with current zoning," according to a DEC statement. " After completion of the interim remedial measure, endpoint samples will be collected and groundwater will be monitored to determine if additional remedial measures are required to render the site suitable for residential use."

 Caption Close COHOES  - Despite a massive fire late Tuesday that rocked a scrapyard, Nate Kelman said the family-owned company plans to reopen for business Thursday morning. "When the dust settled this was a minimal, straight forward incident," said Kelman, vice president of NH Kelman Scrap Recycling Wednesday outside the plant. "It's just outstanding to see a community come together that fast." He said there were no injuries or structural damage to the Euclid St. plant following the blaze that erupted around 6 p.m. Tuesday, forcing the closure of a section of normally busy Interstate 787 in both directions for several hours. Kelman also said some of employees came in on their off days to work the Fourth of July holiday to help with the cleanup so they could resume operations. On Wednesday, Kelman released a statement saying  air quality tests performed at the facility by the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness meets "applicable standards." "Today our warehouse building and office was inspected and deemed to be safe and structurally sound,"  said the statement. It was unclear Wednesday what caused the fire. Kelman and his aunt, Jan Kelman-Heggen also stressed they are grateful for the quick response  of fire crews and emergency first responders. Kelman-Heggen, whose Mechanic Street home abuts the scrapyard, said she rushed home from Waterford to a smoky scene after receiving a flurry of  calls and texts, including one from her sister Fran, who serves as the company's office manager. She was part of  a large group of spectators who took everything in, including witnessing sporadic explosions, from the 10-acre facility that includes a 20,000-square-foot warehouse. The family-run company founded in 1903 handles scrap metal and paper from Canada to North Carolina, according to its website. While the Hellman family downplayed this fire, some of the others over the years have done more damage — and in some cases led to fines from the city and state. In 1998, a destructive blaze quickly spread from the scrap yard to large chunks of metal left on the street, leading the city to fine Kelman for improper storage, according to a Times Union story. In 2012, the state Department of Environmental Conservation fined Kelman $250,000 for violations, including two aluminum smelters at temperatures that could have emitted toxic chemicals, and $5,000 in 2013 for allowing polluted water to escape during heavy rains. On Wednesday, Kelman-Heggen said her nephew and brother Don, who run the company, were still trying to assess the extent of the damage. "We're all kind of numb today," she said reflecting from her backyard where she was cleaning up soot and ashes from the blaze that had blown onto her property. "When it's a business, it's not only watching the fire burn, it's watching your hard work and legacy."

 Bethlehem A Selkirk excavating company must remove a polluting outdoor wood boiler that has been filling the air in the neighborhood with black smoke, or face a $3,000 state fine, under an order by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Daniel Blair, owner of Blair Excavating and Contractors, agreed to take down the boiler used to heat his facility at 682 Elm Ave. by May 15 and not to resell the boiler to anyone else in New York, according to DEC order. DEC regional officials agreed to suspend a $3,000 fine against Blair as long as the boiler is removed. State inspectors tested the boiler on Feb. 9 in response to complaints of excessive smoke, said DEC spokesman Rick Georgeson. Outdoor boilers have become increasingly popular in recent as an alternative heating source, but some earlier models created large amounts of smoke, which led to complaints from neighbors. State rules limit on how much smoke a boiler can make. That limit is 20 percent opacity, which means that no more than 20 percent of available light is blocked by the particles that make up smoke. Blair's boiler tested at 73 percent opacity. As complaints about such boilers grew, DEC in 2010 set stricter pollution limits on wood boilers sold in the state. But it did allow dealers to sell off their inventories of non-compliant boilers, a move opposed by some environmental groups. Still, owners of boilers that exceed state opacity limits can be cited by DEC for the violation. Rules now require that boilers, depending on size, be installed at least 100 feet and as much as 1,000 feet from the nearest property boundary line. Boiler stacks also must be at least 18 feet above ground level. Acceptable fuels include seasoned clean wood or wood pellets made from clean wood. Heating oil liquefied propane or natural gas, as well as newspapers, can be used only as starter fuel. Boilers cannot legally burn garbage; unseasoned wood; wood containing preservatives or other coatings; tires; household chemicals; coal; yard waste (including lawn clippings); plywood and

 Caption Close RENSSELAER COUNTY — The state The departments of Health and Environmental Conservation have been studying whether fish in the Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh area are contaminated with perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), which can be harmful to human health. The study found elevated levels of the compounds, mainly perfluorooctane sulfonate acid (PFOS), in certain fish species in Thayers Pond — one of four bodies of water tested. The state intentionally chose water bodies that are popular among recreation fishers. The other three were the Hoosic River, Little Hoosic River and a stream that drains from the Petersburgh landfill in the Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh areas. Sampling at each site included one or more sportfish species, as well as a minnow species, to evaluate impacts to the ecological food chain. Specifically, DEC analyzed edible portions of the fish for PFCs, including PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). PFOA levels observed in fish from these waters were very low, and the only elevated levels of PFOS were observed in fish from Thayers Pond. "Fishing is critical to the outdoor recreation economy in the state and our research is showing that PFOA is not impacting fish in the Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh areas," said DEC Commissioner DEC is continuing to sample fish from waters in the Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh areas for PFCs, and the resulting new information will be considered along with the currently available information to determine whether future DOH recommendations will change. <a href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/108791.html " target="_blank">Click here</a>

The driver, Logan A. Penzabene, was pronounced dead at the scene and his passenger, Matthew T. Hamilton, was taken to Albany Medical Center Hospital with serious injuries, Bethlehem town police said. Hamilton was listed in critical condition. The two teens, who were traveling in a 2001 Oldsmobile, are from Coeymans and alumni of Ravena-Coeymans-Selkirk High School. School Superintendent Robert Libby deployed "crisis response teams" for students. The driver of the 2013 Freightliner tractor-trailer, John L. Norris Sr., 40, of Clearfield, Pa., was uninjured, police said. Norris was driving for ATS Specialized Inc. from St. Cloud, Minn. River Road between Clapper and Wemple roads were closed for six hours after the 9 a.m. crash. Traffic was backed up in both directions as police and firefighters examined the scene. A preliminary investigation shows that the teens' Oldsmobile crossed into the oncoming lane, crashing with the tractor-trailer. The police are still investigating why. The State Police Troop G Collision Reconstruction unit is requesting that anyone who was in the area around the time of the crash or saw either vehicle on the road prior to the collision to call 439-9973. The state Department of Environmental Conservation Police and Spill Response Team also responded to a minor fuel oil spill from the tractor-trailer. No water sources were contaminated, police said.

 Caption Close <em >Albany</em> A small, brownish weasel that spends much of its life in the water, hunting for fish and frogs, the American mink is a signal for the ecological health of where it lives. Right now, the mink is not doing very well along the Hudson River, largely due to decades of PCB pollution from two General Electric plants in Washington County, according to a joint state and federal study released Thursday. The study found the Hudson River has about 40 percent fewer minks living along it than the ecologically similar Mohawk River, and blamed that disparity on PCB contamination in the minks' diet, which inhibits fertility and increases mortality of young minks. Exposure to PCBs also causes health problems in minks, including jaw lesions and the loss of teeth, the study reported. "Decades of PCB contamination continue to have severe and adverse effects on entire populations of animals, such as mink, in the Hudson River," said Kathryn Jahn, U.S. Department of Interior  case manager for the Hudson. "Habitat and wildlife restoration, or land protection, by General Electric to help address this problem could begin at any time." In the Hudson River study area, a total of 108 minks were detected, compared to 208 minks in the Mohawk River study area. The Mohawk had nearly two minks per square kilometer (about a third of a square mile), compared to between 1.2 minks per square kilometer on the Hudson. Researchers used trained dogs during 2013 and 2014 along more than 300 miles of habitat on the two rivers to locate mink droppings, called scat. The dropping were then analyzed through DNA tests to individual minks. Test results were then used to project how many minks were present. Researchers came from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; the U.S. Geological Survey; and the state Department of Environmental Conservation. Published this summer in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the study is result of efforts that started in 1997 to quantify what harm PCBs caused to the river and how GE should be made to address as part of a Natural Resources Damages Assessment. GE wrapped up a $1.7 billion PCB dredging project in 2014 and is awaiting a report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on whether the cleanup satisfied a 2002 agreement between EPA and the company. GE believes it has done so, while the state and several environmental groups believe that too many PCBs were left behind and will continue to contaminate the river for decades to come. "The job is far from done. The study released today is further evidence of GE's failure to complete the cleanup and EPA's years of failed oversight," according to a statement from the state Department of Environmental Conservation. " New York will continue to use all legal tools to vigorously challenge the EPA and hold GE accountable for the costs of a full cleanup." Said GE spokesman Mark Behan, "The Hudson River is an environmental success story. The limited study of comparative mink scat findings does nothing to diminish the success of the Hudson cleanup or the ongoing environmental recovery of the river as a whole." Continued study of PCB damage to the Hudson comes comes as GE's corporate finances appear increasingly precarious. There is still no timeline on when the  final ecological damages report might be released by the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The three agencies are designated as federal trustees to judge damage to the Hudson. Since the cleanup ended, GE has sparred with both federal agencies — USFW and NOAA — over the agencies' earlier claims that excessive levels of PCBs were left behind in the river. GE dredged PCBs from 40 miles of river bottom between Fort Edward and Troy between 2009 and 2014. That amounted to 310,000 pounds, or 72 percent of what is now known to be in the river. That means 120,000 pounds remain along the bottom, including in the navigation channel of the state's Champlain Canal. This summer, GE's financial woes led it to be as removed from the Down Jones Industrial Average after more than century. This month, the company ousted its CEO and later slashed its normally reliable dividend payment to a penny. Margaret Byrne, a USFW spokeswoman, said concerns over GE's future ability to pay for restoration of natural damages, is "outside the scope" of the most recent report on PCB impacts on mink. This is the sixth such report issued by the federal trustees since 2001 on areas including fishery resources, navigation, waterfowl, groundwater and surface water resources. As part of a final damages report, the trustees would estimate monetary damages that could fund restoration projects on the river. A report issued in February by the three river trustees questioned the effectiveness of the dredging project. That report found that while PCB levels in the river showed a decline, those levels as recently as 2014 remained well above federal safety guidelines, as well above state standards meant to protect humans and animals that eat river fish, acc "Enough time has passed. Enough studies have been done," said Althea Mullarkey, policy analyst for the advocacy group Scenic Hudson that supports further dredging. "It is time for a cooperative natural damages agreement to be made by GE."

 Caption Close NISKAYUNA — Cold War-era radioactive waste could remain stored at the Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory for several years because of a half-billion-dollar mishap four years ago at an underground government disposal facility in the New Mexico desert. As part of an agreement with the state Department of Environmental Conservation, the U.S. Department of Energy said it has no immediate schedule for removing radioactive waste collected during a decade-long demolition and cleanup at the Knolls facility along the Mohawk River on River Road. It could be "several years" before Knolls' waste can be taken to the underground Waste Isolation Pilot Plant outside of Carlsbad, N.M., according to that agreement, signed in February by DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos. "DOE cannot provide dates, at this time, for achievement of intermediate steps to disposition," according to the agreement. The waste is currently stored in 22 containers inside four metal shipping containers near a rail spur on the Knolls property. "This is a bit disconcerting," said Niskayuna Supervisor Yasmine Syed. "I realize that this cannot be moved tomorrow, but I would like to see it be sooner than several more years. ... Some other alternatives have to be found." The agreement also required DOE to submit plans for emergency preparedness in the event of a leak or spill. That plan was to be filed by March 5. Another DOE plan on a "description of what inspection methods will be utilized in order to ensure the detection of releases while keeping exposure risks as low as reasonably achievable" was due to be filed by April 5. Syed said she assumed that a first response to any emergency related to Knolls waste would be made by state or federal officials, since town volunteer firefighters are not trained or equipped to deal with nuclear material. DEC received the DOE application on March 29 to continue the waste storage for an undefined period. That application is being reviewed, the state agency said Monday. Under the DEC agreement, DOE was also to provide a management plan for the waste containers by mid-March. Several attempts Tuesday to obtain comment from DOE officials were not successful. The plans for emergency management, container management and risk assessment were not immediately available. The waste is the result of a DOE-managed cleanup at the facility's former separations process research unit that began in 2006. The buildings were used during the 1950s in experiments to extract uranium for atomic weapons development. According to DOE paperwork, the containers hold so-called transuranic or TRU waste. That means waste which has been "contaminated with alpha emitting transuranic radionuclides." "Many of the drums have shielding either between the inner and outer container and/or wrapped or draped over the outside of the container," according to the February agreement between DEC and DOE. TRU waste is a byproduct of weapons production and requires special precautions for safe disposal. Buried more than 2,000 feet underground, the WIPP facility opened in 1999 and is the nation's only repository to accept TRU waste. The facility was shut down for three years after a 2014 radiation spill in which a containment barrel burst, releasing seven ounces of plutonium and americium. The facility holds about 170,000 containers, according to a January 2017 report in Forbes magazine. It cost about $500 million after the 2014 spill to clean and repair the WIPP, which resumed accepting waste in April 2017. There is now a national backlog of TRU waste to be sent there.

 SARATOGA SPRINGS – For the first time in its history, the city's water system exceeded the federal limit for lead at more than 10 percent of the 60 high risk homes it is required to test, city and state Health Department officials said Friday. Seven homes were affected and their owners were notified. They've been offered bottled water while remediation efforts occur. The city and state will provide free water testing to all homeowners. The city-owned water mains and lines are not leeching lead, according to officials. The lead comes from within the plumbing systems of individual homes. The city Department of Public Works was notified Thursday by the state and is responding to the higher test results. The discovery of the homes having test results of more than 15 parts per billion came about when the city was required to test every six months instead of annually, due to bringing new wells online to supply city drinking water. Public works is responsible for the city's water system. "The public should know that Saratoga Springs' municipal water supply does not contain lead and these results reflect an exceedance in a small number of homes with lead plumbing fixtures," said Public Works Commissioner Anthony "Skip" Scirocco. "We are conducting confirmatory sampling of the impacted homes and taking action to ensure that every resident in our city has clean water. "There are 160 homes classified as high risk in the city. The city rotates the homes through the testing procedures examining 60 at a time. These residences have lead pipes, fixtures with lead in them or pipes soldered with lead. These would be older homes or residences built in the 1980s when lead was used a solder to hold pipes together. State Health Department spokesman Ben Rosen echoed that, saying the report does not mean that lead was present in the city's municipal water supply. The city detected the issue "in a small number of homes‎ during routine monitoring," he said. The state Health Department is offering in-home lead testing kits to all Saratoga Springs residents. Residents whose homes are not part of the high risk testing may still have their water tested for free officials said. They can call 518-402-7650 for information about the free testing or contact freewatertesting@health.ny.gov Residents may also call the city's 24-hour water response line at the Water Treatment Plant at 518-584-1848 to have questions answered by the city staff. Older pipes or plumbing materials in the homes containing lead is believed to be the cause. Rosen said the department is working with the city on a remediation plan and will oversee its implementation, Rosen said. Lead poisoning from pipes grabbed national attention after Flint, Mich., began drawing drinking water from the contaminated Flint River and did not treat the water with anti-corrosive chemicals. This resulted in the lead pipes in the city corroding and lead leaching from pipes contaminating drinking water. In 2016, the Saratoga Springs school district joined the state's school districts to test for lead contamination in its schools. The Geyser Road Crest Elementary School reported exceeding the federal standard of 15 parts per billion at two drinking fountains. City residents concerned about lead contamination in their homes were advised to run the water for at least 30 seconds to flush their pipes before using the water. Mayor Joanne Yepsen said she was glad to see the city's regular testing of its water supply uncovered the problem. The city is expected to draft a plan for remediation of the lead in the water and submit it to the state Health Department for review. The city also will hire a consulting engineer to advise it on possible remedies to the situation; add additional corrosion control treatments; and must notify the public about the lead issues.

To date, no illnesses have been reported to the Ag Department in connection with this product, Ball said. The product is packaged in either a white butcher paper covered wheel or in vacuum sealed plastic, displaying the plant number 36-8524, with a code of 51017. The consumer alert affects all packages with this code. This product was sold at locations including  Hudson, Menands and Tannersville. A routine sample of the cheese, taken by an inspector from the Division of Milk Control and Dairy Services on Oct. 3 was tested by the state Food Laboratory and discovered to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. On Oct. 6, the manufacturer was notified of a preliminary positive test result and voluntarily recalled the product from all their customers. Test results were confirmed on Friday. The cheese will be destroyed by the manufacturer. According to the alert, Listeria contaminated product may cause Listeriosis, a disease that usually causes mild flu-like symptoms in healthy individuals; however, in immune-compromised individuals, meningitis and blood poisoning can occur. Pregnant women are also considered a high-risk group, as Listeriosis can also result in stillbirths. Consumers with questions about the recalled product may call (978) 257-4635.

The Nassau Town Board named the tributary after a Anti-Rent Wars figure Little Thunder as a way to call attention NASSAU — A man whose name is synonymous with the county's worst toxic landfill apparently was dumping those same chemicals where he lived. Acting on a tip, federal investigators last month found PCBs, carcinogenic industrial solvents and other chemicals contaminating the family property of Dewey Loeffel, who ran a nearby landfill during the 1950s and '60s that still leaks dangerous toxins. The discoveries by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at the Loeffel property at 5525 County Route 203 included a buried 10,000-gallon chemical tank as well as a PCB-tainted pond and trichloroethylene (TCE), a human carcinogen, in ground water. According to town assessment records, the 8.8-acre property near Sweets Crossing Road, which includes the Loeffel home, is owned by Carol Loeffel, the 79-year-old daughter-in-law of Dewey Loeffel. When a reporter tried calling a telephone number listed for the residence, the line would ring and then disconnect. In additional to the family home, the property includes several maintenance buildings used by Loeffel to runs his trucking firm as part of his landfill operation, which was in business between 1952 and 1968. "This is where Mr. Loeffel would rinse out his trucks," said Nassau Supervisor David Fleming on Thursday. "I guess this disproves the old country saying that a pig doesn't crap where it sleeps." As complaints mounted from neighbors about dead fish and cattle near the landfill, the state ordered the 19-acre dump closed 1970. It was sealed by the state in 1984, but continued to leak dangerous chemicals into nearby Valatie Kill and Kinderhook Lake. EPA officials went to the Loeffel family property acting on a tip received last summer, according to agency spokesman Elias Rodriguez. Investigators went to the Loeffel property last month. Ground-penetrating radar revealed the buried chemical tank. "The pond is a mess with PCBs, and there are volatile organic compounds all over the place," Fleming said. A drinking water well was found to be contaminated with TCE, Fleming said. He said tests of water wells for more than a dozen neighboring homes on Rudat Road, Maple View Avenue, and Brookside Drive found water there was safe to drink. A grassroots activist who has been demanding for years that the landfill be excavated and disposed of said she was not surprised by EPA's findings at the Loeffel residence. "This is something that was raised to the state Department of Environmental Conservation many years ago. Guess they never found anything," said Kelly Travers-Main, a member of founder of UNCAGED, a grassroots advocacy group formed in 2000 to push for a dump cleanup and an accounting of potential health risks to people who live or lived nearby. She credited Fleming for "keeping this thing moving" and EPA officials for finally locating pollution on the Loeffel property. Fleming said there will be "months of investigation" at the new Loeffel site to determine the extent and location of pollution, including soil sampling, and testing of wetlands and drainage. "We have to ask how many more such sites there might be like this." Over 16 years, Loeffel buried about 46,000 tons of industrial waste in his unlined landfill off Mead Road, about five miles from his home. Since the landfill had no liner system, it allowed chemicals to leak into the ground unchecked. Most of the waste came from General Electric, but Schenectady Chemical and the Bendix Co. also dumped there. The dump has been a persistent environmental headache. Its cleanup was first ordered by the state in 1968 to be done by Loeffel. After a dozen fruitless years, the state took over the project in 1980 after striking a deal with GE known as "Seven Sites" agreement. Under the agreement, which covered Loeffel and six other PCB-tainted sites upstate, GE put up $30 million to handle all cleanup costs, and the state agreed that the company would not have to come up with any more cash — ever. Part of that money paid for the cap placed over the Loeffel dump in 1984. Three decades later, with the dump still leaking chemicals, EPA assumed control and installed a treatment system for rainwater passing into the ground and through the dump. Many millions of dollars have been spent by the state and federal government on the landfill beyond what the Seven Sites agreement provided. While Loeffel made few, if any public comments about his dump, he was sued in 1991 by a housing developer who said the dump had made his nearby property worthless. While testifying under oath, Loeffel said he could not recall details of his operation of the dump and of contact from Rensselaer County and state health officials who were concerned over the safety of dump operations. Fleming said the town wants the dump dug out and the chemicals properly disposed of. " Otherwise, this will be leaking forever," he said. PCB and other pollution has spread to nearby Valatie Kill, Nassau Lake and Kinderhook Lake in Columbia County. PCB-tainted fish from those bodies of water have been listed by the state as unsafe to eat since 1980. Fleming said 26 private wells were tested in the area of the new contamination, and the preliminary results found none have dangerous levels of chemicals such as PCBs, which was the contamination found at the Route 203 site. Three wells were found to have the chemical TCE present, but levels were low enough for safe human consumption. Rensselaer County provided bottled water to residents when testing began March 18, as well as backup water supplies at the Nassau ambulance facility.

 Caption Close ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico , there was the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, at the time the nation's largest oil spill. The 987-foot tanker, carrying 53 million gallons of crude, struck Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. on March 24, 1989. Within hours, it unleashed an estimated 10.8 million gallons of thick, toxic crude oil into the water. Storms and currents then smeared it over 1,300 miles of shoreline. For a generation of people around the world, the spill was seared into their memories by images of fouled coastline in Prince William Sound, of sea otters, herring and birds soaked in oil, of workers painstakingly washing crude off the rugged beaches. Twenty five years later, most of the species have recovered, said Here's a look at what's changed since the spill: —FISHERMAN <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel= about_us&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex = solr&amp;query=%22Bernie+Culbertson%22">Bernie Culbertson</a> "The bottom fell out of the price of fish," he said. Pink salmon that sold for 80 cents per pound fell to 8 cents per pound. Consumers turned to farm fish or tuna out of fear of tainted salmon. His boat caught 2.5 million pound of pinks one season and lost money. Culbertson turned to other fisheries, traveling as far as California. Fishing 12 months a year, his marriage failed. Friends couldn't repay loans and lost boats or homes. Exxon compensation checks, minus what fishermen earned on spill work, arrived too late for many. The fisheries today are not the same. " The shrimp are slowly, slowly coming back. The crab aren't back. The herring aren't back. The salmon are back in abundance," he said. —INDUSTRY At the time of the spill, complacency among government officials and the oil industry had set in after a dozen years of safe shipments, said When the tanker ran aground, for instance, spill response equipment was buried under snow. Now, Alyeska has 108 skimmers, 49 miles of boom and on-water storage capacity of almost 38 million gallons. North Slope oil must be transported in double-hull tankers, which must be escorted by two tugs. Radar monitors the vessel's position as well as that of icebergs. The company conducts two major spill drills are conducted each year. And nearly 400 local fishing boat owners are trained to deploy and maintain boom —PACIFIC HERRING After the spill, the population of herring crashed. It is now listed as "not recovering. " The silvery fish is a key species because it is eaten by salmon, seabirds and marine mammals from otters to whales. Four years after the spill, the estimated herring population based on modeling shrunk from 120 metric tons to less than 30 metric tons. How that happened remains a question, said Here's what's known: Adult herring feed on zooplankton, which crashed for three years after the spill. With less to eat, herring may have been more susceptible to disease normally fended off within a herring population. Herring populations can stabilize at a low or high number, but something has prevented a rebound. Oil likely is no longer a factor, Pegau said. —SEA OTTERS Responders estimated that as many as 3,000 sea otters died the first year. Hundreds more died in the years after of exposure to oil that persisted in sediment, where otters dig for clams. Three factors could have had an impact on the otters' ability to survive. Oiled fur loses insulating value. Otters ingest oil as they groom, and researchers years after the spill found blood chemistry evidence consistent with liver damage. Grooming takes time away from feeding. "One of the lessons we can take from this is that the chronic effects of oil in the environment can persist for decades," said The U.S. Geological Survey research biologist is the lead author of a federal study released last month that concludes that sea otters have finally returned to pre-spill numbers. —PIGEON GUILLEMOTS The pigeon guillemot (GEEL'-ah-mot), which looks like a black pigeon with web feet, is one species that has not recovered. Numbers were declining before the spill. An estimated 2,000 to 6,000 guillemots, or 10 to 15 percent of the population in spill areas, died from acute oiling. Researchers suspect river otters, mink and other predators targeted guillemot eggs as an alternative to foraging on oiled beaches. Like sea otters and another bird that took years to recover, harlequin ducks, pigeon guillemot's forage for invertebrates in sediment and likely were affected by lingering oil, said The decline of its other prey, juvenile herring, didn't help. Numbers continue to decline in both oiled and non-oiled areas. Irons has proposed reducing mink numbers on the heavily oiled Naked Islands, once prime habitat for guillemots, to restore their numbers.

 Caption Close <em>Rensselaer</em> The first step toward a $41 million project to dredge PCBs and other toxins from the Hudson River near a former Rensselaer dye factory is expected to start this fall. BASF Corp. will begin by installing more than 500 feet of new steel bulkhead to toughen a seawall along the Hudson on Riverside Avenue, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. The seawall must be stabilized before the company can begin the river dredging, which is scheduled to start next year, according to DEC. BASF will be performing and paying for the cleanup under the state Superfund program. PCBs found in that part of the river did not come from BASF, which did not use the chemical during its production, but the other hazardous compounds did. " PCBs were also found in upstream sediment samples at comparable levels" to the area that BASF studied, according to DEC. DEC wants dredging in the river to remove PCBs, volatile organics, and toxic heavy metals like lead, cadmium, copper, mercury, zinc and arsenic, that got into the river from several production sewer and storm water discharge pipes. The former factory was knocked down in 2010. PCB levels in that part of the river reached up to 270 parts per million. The safety standard is 1 ppm. The dye factory closed in 2000, and that year, BASF signed an agreement with DEC to clean up the 75-acre plant and a 35-acre site to the south. The DEC plan calls for dredging about 38,700 cubic yards from about 12 acres of tainted river bottom that extend along about 1,800 feet of riverfront at the Port of Rensselaer. That is equivalent to about a dozen Olympic-sized swimming pools. Dredging in the river would be done to a maximum depth of about eight feet. About 7,000 cubic yards of the least-polluted dredgings could be processed at the site through a process called thermal desorption. That would work by heating contaminated soils to 800 degrees Fahrenheit to evaporate chemicals into gas. The gas is then run through a second treatment which runs at a higher temperature to destroy dangerous components in the gas. The rest of the dredgings, which would contain higher levels of PCBs and other pollution, would be removed for disposal at a hazardous waste landfill. BASF tests of the site found no evidence  that pollution was migrating through soil or groundwater to surrounding properties.

 Caption Close <em>Bethlehem</em> A scrap metal and electronics recycling yard in Bethlehem has been spilling unsafe levels of toxic mercury into the Hudson River, according to the state The state is beefing up the water pollution permit for That pipe was among two stormwater drains at the 140 Port Road South facility that were not included under the current state permit, according to DEC paperwork filed last week. Tests found one of those pipes was discharging rainwater that contained mercury at 1,100 parts per trillion, well beyond the state limit of 50 parts per trillion. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin and is especially dangerous for children and fetuses. Most human exposure to water-borne mercury comes from eating fish contaminated with mercury. Sims is one of the world's largest metals and electronics recyclers, and runs a scrap metal and electronics recycling operation at the Bethlehem facility. Electronics can contain various components with mercury. Road salt is also stored on the site. Calls to the company for comment were not returned on Tuesday. A Sims affiliate, Port Albany Ventures LLC, took over the state water pollution permit when it acquired the site in 2005. Based in New York City, Sims runs more than 130 recycling yards in North America, along with nearly 100 more in Australia and Europe. At its Bethlehem yard, the company buys and shreds "ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal, stainless and electronics," according to the Sims web site. Materials are then shipped away by barge for use in manufacturing. The facility falls outside the jurisdiction of the Port of Albany, said Port Manager DEC wants to add the two previously unregulated drain pipes to the company's current state water pollution permit, require the company to reduce its mercury emissions to safe levels, and regularly test discharges into the river from the yard for  mercury, and other dangerous chemicals, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and chlorinated phenols. DEC could not immediately indicate how long the two unregulated pipes were in place, or when the testing was conducted that uncovered the unsafe mercury levels. Under the proposed permit, Sims would have to test its drain pipes after rain storms for the next nine months. DEC spokewoman In 2014, Sims was fined nearly $190,000 by the At the time, Sims had no protective covering on the conveyor moving scrap metals from its shredder and onto ships, so the metal dust blew off the top and fell off the sides of the belt and into the Bay. EPA tested the shoreline near the conveyor and found high levels of toxic metals.

 <em >Albany</em> While the $1.7 billion PCB cleanup of the Hudson River is showing promise, federal officials also said Thursday that it could take years of additional study to know if it really worked. For now, no additional dredging is planned. That finding by the Under federal Superfund rules, McCabe also did not rule out the possibility that EPA could order further work by GE  if subsequent studies of PCB levels warrant that, but opponents pushing for more dredging warned the likelihood of that happening is remote. EPA also reported that "as many as eight or more years" of studies of PCBs in fish will be needed before federal officials can be sure levels are declining as expected. Part of EPA's plan also relies on "monitored natural attenuation" for PCBs to reach safe limits. That means the agency will observe whether PCBs are declining naturally over time, a step which opponents said meant only hoping and waiting. "That isn't success, it's an unfinished problem," said Daniel Raichel, staff attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Currently, the best EPA can say is that river fish could be safe to eat once a week in "55 years or more,"according to the 1,000-page report. Studies done by EPA during the last year since dredging wrapped up in late 2015 are "not sufficient" to project that timetable more precisely. "This report is telling us whether the project is now working as expected," said McCabe. " This report is not an EPA decision on whether more dredging ultimately should be done." EPA oversaw the cleanup by GE, which paid to dredge about 2.65 million cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment from a 40-mile stretch of the Hudson between Fort Edward and Troy. That amounted to about 310,000 pounds of PCBs, or about 72 percent of what is now known to be in the river. That means about 120,000 pounds still remain along the bottom, including in the navigation channel of the state-owned Champlain Canal. Walter Mugdan, acting deputy regional EPA administrator, said pushing to remove more PCBs would have raised the cost of the project by as much as $500 million, while only shaving off six years from the projected timetable of when fish would again be safe to eat. GE welcomed the report as proof that no further dredging of the Hudson is needed, a position it has steadfastly maintained since work finished. The project is "functioning as intended and will be protective of human health and the environment. No additional dredging in the upper or lower Hudson is recommended," said  company spokesman Mark Behan. In December, GE asked EPA to issue a "certificate of completion" for the project, which would find the company met terms of its 2002 cleanup agreement with EPA. Dredging supporters warn that step could absolve GE of further responsibility, leaving state taxpayers to deal with the costs of any additional work. EPA drew immediate fire from U.S. Senator Seggos said EPA had "failed" the state and vowed to fight for more dredging, although he did not specify how the state might do that. He has already vowed that the state see that more dredging gets done if the federal government will not. McCabe said EPA was not "taking issue" with Seggos or blocking the state from "taking further action." "EPA cannot possibly support a finding that GE's limited dredging has been sufficient to protect New Yorkers' public health and the environment," said Schneiderman. Gillibrand said she was "disappointed that the EPA couldn't muster up the courage to do the job they set out to do and clean up the Hudson." A coalition of environmental groups, some of which were on an EPA advisory panel for the report, also criticized federal officials for ignoring a 2016 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that claimed PCB levels in fish will remain at unsafe levels for decades to come. NOAA, along with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFW) and DEC, are responsible under Superfund law for assessing environmental damage caused by PCBs released into the river for decades by GE plants in Fort Edward and Hudson Falls in Washington County. DEC raised similar concerns with EPA late last year, particularly over elevated PCB levels in fish in the lower Hudson south of Albany. The EPA report said PCBs in that part of the river, around Poughkeepsie, were declining less than had been expected. The report said that may be due to the tidal nature of the river there. Scenic Hudson President Ned Sullivan said, "By ignoring solid scientific evidence from New York state and its sister (federal) agencies and concluding that the Hudson River Superfund project will be protective, EPA is washing its hands of responsibility." Sullivan also urged EPA not to issue GE the completion notice. He warned such a step "could certainly let GE off the hook for any further liability, leaving New York state with a contaminated river, and taxpayers with the cost of covering any other remediation." Other environmental groups to criticize EPA included the Hudson River Fishermen's Association, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Riverkeeper, and Sierra Club. The EPA main report did not mention the NOAA and DEC fish reports, instead finding that "No other information has come to light that could call into question" the project's effectiveness. Last year, EPA had disputed the NOAA report as flawed. EPA spokeswoman Larisa Romanowski said federal officials "carefully considered NOAA's analysis and the New York state recommendations," and included the NOAA study in a seperate appendix to the main report. A federal trustee took a non-confrontational stance with EPA. "We will continue to work with EPA. With our co-trustees, the New York  state DEC and NOAA, we will assess and work toward restoring the cherished natural resources of the Hudson River," said Margaret Byrne,  the USFW river trustee.

 State regulators have ordered the Army to look into the possibility that leaking methane gas from an old dump may combine with other hazardous chemicals and pose a health risk to residents of a new Marin subdivision. The volatile gas, experts say, could act as a conduit for toxic chemicals to escape from the capped landfill, poison the groundwater and create hazardous fumes in nearby homes at the old Explosion remains the primary risk from methane gas that is seeping up within 100 feet of home sites in the partially completed Hamilton Meadows. The In a Feb. 7 letter to the The 15-acre former dump at Hamilton Field, known as Landfill 26, contains 10 such chemicals, including benzene, which can cause cancer and birth defects. Water board officials ordered the Army to submit a detailed response by March 30, and warned that an inadequate reply may result in civil fines of as much as $1,000 a day. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Jim+McAlister%22">Jim McAlister</a> "We did detect (the chemicals) out there but in very low concentrations," said McAlister. The low levels did not pose a health risk, he said. "We continue to monitor for it and watch for it." Construction at Hamilton Meadows was halted last month because tests showed that the methane gas had migrated into a 150- to 200-foot buffer zone between the landfill and new homes. Almost one-third of 235 planned homes at Hamilton Meadows have been built, and more than a dozen have been occupied. Construction of dozens more have been put on hold while air and water tests are conducted. "Methane is an excellent transport or channel for volatile organic compounds, such as MTBE and benzene," said <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Stephen+Lester%22">Stephen Lester</a> "It's a little like the (chemicals) are hitchhiking with the methane, going along for a free ride they wouldn't ordinarily get.

The The Air Force capped the dump with high-strength plastic in 1995, but it hasn't kept the methane from creeping toward the subdivision. Hamilton Meadows also sits atop a plume of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, that leaked from a Navy gas station. State water quality officials concluded that the MTBE would not endanger residents -- as long as they did not plant fruit trees, dig wells or expose themselves to polluted groundwater. Methane, an odorless and colorless gas, is commonly generated by decomposing dumps. The gas can cause an explosion if ignited in confined spaces. The developer, Shea Homes, has hired a consultant to determine whether methane gas has entered any homes. The home builder has also pressed the Army to prevent the methane gas from migrating across the buffer zone.

 Caption Close Bert Bowers had never seen anything like the EPA van. It pulled into the old Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in 2002, a white vehicle about the size of a U-Haul truck, with what looked like a small, air-conditioned laboratory inside, hooked up to a radiation-scanning device. He was intrigued. Bowers, a lanky 43-year-old with a South Carolina drawl, had worked as a radiation technician and safety trainer for 25 years, mostly at nuclear power plants. Recently he had taken a job at the San Francisco Shipyard project along the city’s southeast coast — a 500-acre redevelopment site that promised homes, playgrounds and businesses for a space-constrained city with a huge housing shortage. Much of the site was still laced with dangerous, long-lasting, radioactive isotopes from the 1940s, when the Navy used the shipyard to perform animal experiments with radiation and to decontaminate ships exposed to atomic-bomb tests in the Pacific Ocean. Before houses and storefronts could be built there, radioactive material had to be identified and removed. The main company in charge of the cleanup has long been Tetra Tech, a $2.8 billion federal contracting giant. At the time, Bowers worked for New World Environmental, a company that specialized in cleaning up radiological contaminants and later became an important Tetra Tech subcontractor. He’d been told the radiation “scanner van” from the Environmental Protection Agency was cutting-edge, full of supersensitive gizmos, and was excited to see it in action. “You’re hoping you’re really going to peel the scab back and find where some of the problems are,” he recently recalled. Bowers chatted with the EPA technician who was preparing to operate it. How effective was the van? Was it going to work? His answer, Bowers said: “Don’t get your hopes up.” The plan that day was for Bowers to follow in his own vehicle as the scanner van drove through Parcel A, a 75-acre swath of land in the shipyard where the city hoped to build thousands of new homes. If the van identified any “hot spots,” Bowers would then investigate those areas on foot, with more sensitive, handheld instruments. The entire, 935-acre shipyard site is divided into parcels labeled A through G — a jigsaw puzzle of lands and waters variously contaminated by heavy metals, asbestos, PCBs and radioactive waste. The parcel boundaries, meant to help organize the cleanup, are just lines on a map, not physical partitions. Parcel A is the farthest inland, uphill from the bay and long considered by the Navy and the EPA to be free of concerning amounts of radioactivity. The atomic bomb attacks and tests of the 20th century spread fallout around the Earth, establishing a trace background level of radioactive isotopes like plutonium-239, cesium-137 and strontium-90. Then the Navy released more of these materials at Hunters Point in the 1940s and 1950s, along with radium-226, which was used to illuminate tool displays and deck markers at night. Even extremely tiny amounts of certain isotopes can harm humans, and the EPA determines the acceptable level of risk for various environmental contaminants on Superfund sites like the shipyard. The EPA’s default cleanup goal for radium is two-thousandths of a picocurie, the amount of radioactivity emitted by the merest speck of radium — two-thousandths of a millionth of a millionth of a gram of material. On that day in 2002, the EPA van didn’t find any hot spots on Parcel A — “no radiation above natural background levels,” according to one EPA document. Based partly on the results from the scanner van, Parcel A was given a clean bill of health by federal, state and local officials. No further searches for radioactivity were ordered there. The Navy transferred the parcel to the city in 2004. The following year the city turned it over to a commercial developer, Lennar / FivePoint, which broke ground on new homes in 2013. Since then, Parcel A has lurched back to life, with 300 housing units already completed and another 150 under construction. But as Parcel A became a place where people live, work, and play, other parts of the shipyard have been engulfed by a growing scandal. At the center of it is Tetra Tech, the Navy’s favored cleanup contractor. In the last decade, several former shipyard workers, including Bowers, have complained about safety violations and outright fraud at the heart of the cleanup effort. At first they took their concerns to Tetra Tech, and in several cases, they said Tetra Tech fired or sidelined them. Then they went to regulators and journalists, accusing Tetra Tech of falsifying data and cutting corners to please the Navy, which wanted the parcels cleaned up as fast as possible. Now, years later, the government seems to be paying attention. On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department announced that two former Tetra Tech supervisors, Justin Hubbard and Stephen Rolfe, had each pleaded guilty to falsifying records in connection with the cleanup, swapping suspect soil with clean dirt to make it appear that areas were free of harmful radiation. Both were sentenced to eight months in prison. Reports released last year by the Navy and the EPA said that up to 97 percent of the soil samples taken in two areas of the shipyard site could not be trusted. Tetra Tech has maintained that the Navy and regulators call the shots and set the cleanup criteria, not the company. “We stand by our work,” according to a spokeswoman. Still, Tetra Tech has agreed to pay for retesting. Tetra Tech is no longer working at Hunters Point, having been “demobilized upon completion of the on-site work,” said the spokeswoman, who did not respond to follow-up questions. So far, Parcel A has escaped this new wave of scrutiny. Many of the government offices long responsible for watching over the Navy’s shoulder as the cleanup project unfolds — including the EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, CalEPA and the city’s Office of Community Development and Infrastructure — have repeatedly assured the public that Parcel A has been extensively checked and poses no danger. “For those already living on the Shipyard,” Rep. Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on April 25, “it is important to remember that the Navy and EPA have confirmed that people who live on, work at and visit the Hunters Point area are safe.” But according to Bowers and other former radiation workers at the shipyard, Parcel A has never been adequately checked for radioactive contaminants. The EPA scanner van looked at only a fraction of Parcel A, and was incapable of identifying certain types of radiation known to be present at the shipyard, according to one of the whistle-blowers and an independent expert  familiar with the van and its capabilities. That’s not all. Bowers and another whistle-blower, Anthony Smith, said they later found “hot” samples of radioactive material at locations that were either inside Parcel A or adjacent to it, within a stone’s throw of condos and businesses. Bowers and Smith say that Tetra Tech ignored or covered up those readings. In response to questions about Parcel A, Lennar Corp., the former parent of San Francisco Shipyard developer FivePoint, said: “We have relied on environmental regulators who have repeatedly assured us that Parcel A is clean and safe. We take this matter very seriously and are looking into it further with the relevant government agencies.” FivePoint executive Kofi Bonner added that the company’s partnership with the city “begins with the understanding that the Shipyard parcels are thoroughly tested” and “properly cleaned.” The city directed inquiries about Parcel A to officials with the Navy and the EPA. The Navy did not respond to specific questions and instead sent links to web pages with histories and documents about Parcel A. “Its safety has been verified repeatedly and consistently over decades by state and federal regulators,” one of the Navy pages reads in part. A sub-headline says, “No Health Concerns for Parcel A Residents.” An EPA spokeswoman echoed the Navy, sending an answer that included verbatim quotes from a 2-year-old EPA fact sheet: “Historically, the majority of Parcel A was used for residences and administrative offices, not industrial activities. The only radiological materials found at Parcel A were sandblast grit and firebricks; these have since been removed.” The spokesperson said that Tetra Tech performed only limited cleanup on Parcel A, and the EPA had no reason to question that work “based on the information we have at this time.” In fact, everyone agrees that Tetra Tech did minimal radiological work on Parcel A. The EPA and Navy had determined the land was clean, so never ordered a full soil sampling. And that’s the problem, according to whistle-blowers and experts who say there is no way to know exactly what is in the ground at Parcel A. The land was never rigorously inspected for radiation. Navy and EPA analyses of Parcel A are based on incomplete historical records and decades-old surveys. And for several overlapping reasons — fraud by Tetra Tech, government oversight failings, disruptions caused by recent construction, and the sheer passage of time — there’s cause to question whether contaminated materials have been churned up on Parcel A or have migrated there from other parts of the shipyard. The upshot: Parcel A may be free of radioactivity above harmful levels. Or it may not. We simply don’t know, says Don Wadsworth, president of New World Environmental, the former radiation-control subcontractor for Tetra Tech. Around 2007, Wadsworth voiced concerns to Tetra Tech about the integrity of the cleanup, and said Tetra Tech began to phase him out; New World’s last year on the project was 2009. Wadsworth and Bowers have agreed to appear at a Board of Supervisors hearing on May 14, where they plan to argue that the entire site needs to be retested for radiation — including Parcel A. “The people who certified that the other parcels were clean were caught falsifying their data,” Wadsworth said. “If you found out that all the studs in the house that the contractor made for you were made out of bread sticks, you’d have to question the whole foundation up. And that’s what you have to do here. You have to question everything they did.” In recent months, residents of Parcel A have started to wonder about the ground beneath their feet. Linda Parker Pennington, who moved into a three-bedroom town house with her family in June 2015, said she had felt reassured by the promises of the developer and the Navy. But now, she said, she worries about her teenage son and the other neighborhood children who play in the grass and dirt on the parcel and may wander beyond its borders. If the Navy never really went looking for radioactivity on Parcel A, and if two Tetra Tech supervisors lied about what they were doing on other parts, how can officials be certain that residents in Parcel A haven’t been exposed to harmful radiation? “Most children like to venture,” Pennington said. “The parcels are an artificial construct that make it sound like there are barriers between them, but really there are not.” “If I was living there,” Bowers said, “yes, I would be worried.” Radioactive materials have to be strictly controlled. If not, they travel, imperceptible to humans. The minuscule particles get picked up by shoes and boots and rivulets of rainwater. Stirred into a cloud of dust, the breeze carries them. Nature has its way — wind, storm, earthquake, soil erosion, fire—and moves radioactive material from one place to another. Humans can easily ingest radioactive particles, spread from dirty hands to lips with the bite of a sandwich or a drag from a cigarette. “Radiation is essentially subatomic bullets,” said Daniel Hirsch, retired director of the Environmental and Nuclear Policy Program at UC Santa Cruz. If the bullets damage genetic material in a cell, a cancerous tumor can grow. There were multiple sources of radiation at Hunters Point in its heyday, the 1940s and 1950s. Ships that returned from atomic bomb tests in the South Pacific, dosed with fallout, were decontaminated in the Hunters Point dry docks, a process that included sandblasting the radioactive exteriors of the ship. (The largest dry dock, No. 4. , long defunct, almost nips the eastern edge of what is now Parcel A.) Another source was the Naval Radiological Defense Laboratory, a cluster of buildings where government scientists blasted animals with radiation and fed them isotopes to learn about the possible effects on humans. At night, the shipyard glowed with radioactive paint. Much of what the public knows about this contamination is documented in a 665-page report called a Historical Radiological Assessment, produced by New World and the Navy and finalized in 2004. They researched old Navy records, spoke with former workers at the site, and conducted soil surveys and new searches for radiation. The assessment depicts the old shipyard as a chaotic, messy, dangerous workplace with lax safety standards. According to one former worker who was interviewed for the assessment, the radioactive carcasses of large mammals were sometimes cut up with axes, the parts stuffed into 55-gallon drums for burial at sea or in the landfill. One lab building next to Parcel A contained a room full of caged dogs given lethal doses of radiation, the report says. The dogs bled and defecated in their cages, clogging the drains with radioactive excrement until the floor was covered in 6 inches of water. As workers decontaminated the ships, the assessment says, they sandblasted the surfaces with coal grit to remove the toxic paint. “The grit would blow toward the bay,” one worker reported, “but, occasionally, the wind would blow it back over the base. Blasting would not stop because the wind changed direction.” In that direction lay Parcel A and the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood — a community of predominantly African American residents. Many residents worked at the shipyard or are the children of those workers. For decades, they have blamed the site for elevated rates of cancer and other health problems. Last week, a lawyer representing Bayview-Hunters Point residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Tetra Tech for harm suffered as a result of the botched cleanup. Tetra Tech has called the suit “factually incorrect and meritless,” saying that the company “stands by its work at Hunters Point.” “It is a source of fear and chronic terror,” said Dr. Ahimsa Porter Sumchai, a longtime environmental activist who grew up in the Southeast section of the city. “What is so unrelenting about it is the way this project just keeps going forward like a bulldozer, no matter what.” When cleanup contractors went hunting through Navy archives in the early 2000s, they found evidence of past radioactive contamination in 90 buildings. Of these, a few were on the area designated Parcel A. One was Building 816, a concrete lab containing a high-voltage accelerator; tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen, was stuck to the walls. Navy records said that the building was subsequently decontaminated and three additional checks for tritium contamination found none. Another problem spot was Building 322, a former guard office that had been moved to Parcel A from another part of the shipyard in 1959. A New World investigation of the building in 2002 turned up readings of cesium-137 and europium-152 at “slightly” elevated levels. New World sent Bowers in. He saw that the floor of Building 322 was covered with four or five layers of tiles — which indicated to him that chemical spills had probably been covered up. With no way to peel off the tiles or test them, the Navy decided to have Bowers remove the entire floor and foundation. He bagged up the pieces for disposal in a special landfill that handles radioactive and asbestos waste. The rest of the building was demolished in 2004 by Tetra Tech. Aside from surveying and these buildings, New World and Tetra Tech performed no other official radiological investigations on Parcel A, according to Wadsworth and Bowers. The most toxic stuff was thought to be on the other parcels, and that’s where technicians went looking. They focused on Parcel F, the water off the shoreline, where Wadsworth went diving to take samples of underwater sediment and discovered pockets of elevated radium-226. They scoured Parcel E, home of a 22-acre landfill that caught fire in 2000, and found cesium-137 in the drain lines. Bowers remembers seeing radium-painted deck markers “just scattered all over the grassy slopes on the way to the bay.” Bits of disintegrated radium dials — highly radioactive metal specks — lay in piles of seashells. After a while, getting all these hits in the areas surrounding Parcel A, Don Wadsworth started feeling funny about ignoring that portion of the site. He thought the Navy should approve a thorough radiological probe of Parcel A, with handheld radiation detectors, and said he asked the Navy for permission around 2003. “It made sense,” Wadsworth recalled. “We’re finding all this stuff at the foot of the hill. We should go up the hill.” The Navy, he said, disagreed and said no. “Their position was it had already been scanned and said good to go by the EPA.” The Navy did not comment when asked for a response. The scan the Navy referred to was the one done by the scanner van the EPA had brought to Hunters Point the year before, and the EPA’s 40-page report on the van ’s findings — a crucial piece of the narrative about Parcel A that would be presented to the public in years to come. The EPA made mixed claims about the van’s capabilities and performance, sometimes admitting its limitations, other times emphasizing that the van’s negative readings should give people great confidence. “It offers an otherwise unobtainable sense of security that nothing has been overlooked,” the agency wrote in 2002. Later, the EPA would claim in an official document, “EPA scanned the entire surface of the parcel.” The EPA’s conclusion would influence the process around Parcel A, giving comfort to stakeholders and helping to justify its transfer to the city. For instance, in a 2004 white paper, an environmental expert hired by the city would emphasize the van’s negative readings: “Based on the scanner van surveys,” he would write, “I conclude that no residual contamination from HPS (Hunters Point Shipyard) operations is indicated within the surveyed areas of Parcel A.” But Bowers had seen first-hand that the vehicle’s abilities were limited. More ice-cream truck than off-road vehicle, the van was able to reach only locations that had decent roads, which amounted to a small percentage of Parcel A. As he followed the van in his own vehicle, he saw it struggle to navigate constant obstacles — fences, locked gates, rocky, unpaved terrain and roads disrupted by potholes and weeds. The instruments in the van never sensed any problem areas. “Not one place was pointed out,” Bowers recalled. “Not one flag was hit.” On other days, when Bowers wasn’t following the van, it drove across other areas of the site, including locations where technicians later discovered very high levels of radioactivity. But the EPA van didn’t spy any trouble spots on the other parcels, either, EPA records say. Wadsworth, Bowers and other experts think they know why: The van was at least half-blind. Originally built in 1980 to scan for radioactive waste in uranium mines and since adapted for soil screening, it was tuned to detect gamma rays, which made it a crude tool for Hunters Point, according to Wadsworth. Plutonium-239, one of the deadliest isotopes at the shipyard site, which has a half-life of 24,000 years, mostly emits alpha particles; strontium-90, which mimics calcium and builds up in bones when ingested, emits beta radiation. The van wasn’t designed to notice those isotopes. “The scanning of Parcel A with that van would be ineffective,” Wadsworth said. After reviewing the EPA’s scanner van report, Hirsch, the nuclear expert, agreed. He said such scanner vans are supposed to be used only as a gross screening tool to help focus subsequent soil sampling, which is done by taking thousands of samples in the field and then sending the dirt to be tested in a laboratory. “The scanner van was incapable of seeing most radioactivity at levels of health concern,” Hirsch said. “The van simply can’t be used to declare the site safe.” In response to questions about the scanner van, an EPA spokeswoman said the van offers only a “first look” at possible contamination “and is often used to prioritize more soil sampling for further radioanalyses.” “The results of the scanner van are one line of evidence that EPA relied on in investigating questions brought up regarding Parcel A,” she said. “But it is not the only source of information.” <typographytag class="character" displayname="TypographyTag(1)" name="TypographyTag1">After the EPA van visited Parcel A and pronounced it clear of worrisome radiation, the Navy never scanned the parcel again. However, two former Tetra Tech employees say they later discovered elevated radiation levels in Parcel A by accident.</typographytag> Bowers said that around February 2004 he took a hot sample on Parcel A. He was starting to investigate some of the manholes at Hunters Point, where radioactive materials might have been flushed. He wanted to get a “clean background,” an uncontaminated sample he could compare others against. So he went down manholes on Parcel A where he assumed there was no dangerous radiation, and took scrapings of soil that he sent to the lab. “We weren’t expecting to see anything,” Bowers said. But when the reports came back from Tetra Tech’s on-site lab operated by New World, according to Bowers, they showed that the soil samples from the Parcel A manholes contained “seriously” elevated levels of radium. The reports, he said, also listed high uncertainty levels for the radium numbers, signaling doubt about the results. Bowers said Tetra Tech then sent the reports to the Navy. After that, he never heard anything back. “They obviously dismissed it,” he says. No additional tests for radium on Parcel A were ordered. Neither Tetra Tech nor the Navy responded when asked for comment. Last year, a former radiation technician named Anthony Smith gave a sworn declaration about his experiences at Hunters Point. The declaration is part of a petition asking the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to pull Tetra Tech’s license to handle radioactive materials. In his testimony, Smith described a soil sample he took in 2009 from Parcel A. His supervisor, Justin Hubbard — one of the two Tetra Tech managers who has pleaded guilty to falsifying soil samples — told Smith that in preparation for some remediation work on sewer lines, a clean background sample was needed. Smith walked to a waist-high fence near the intersection of Fisher Avenue and Spear Street, along the eastern edge of Parcel A, where it borders a thin strip of land designated as “UC-2,” or Utility Corridor 2. With a hand trowel, Smith said, he dug a hole in the ground about 6 inches deep. The hole was either inside Parcel A or a few feet beyond it, in UC-2. Smith says variously in his declaration that he was “near” Parcel A, “in” Parcel A, and “along the border”; from the spot he had chosen, he could look up the hill to the spot where condos would be built on Parcel A. Smith scooped some dirt from the bottom of the hole into a plastic sample jar. He then gave the jar of dirt to Hubbard, and Hubbard took it to the lab, he testified. The next morning, Hubbard told Smith and others that the soil sample had come back “hot,” showing radioactive cesium-137 at a level of 2 to 3 picocuries — an amount of radiation about 18 to 26 times higher than what the Navy deemed acceptable. It was an important find, Wadsworth said in discussing Smith’s declaration: “ You’re 20 times above background with that one sample. That’s significant enough to cause more surveys. Because you want to find out where that came from.” Instead of doing surveys, though, Hubbard told Smith and other workers to “get rid of it and not say a word,” according to Smith’s declaration. (Reached on the phone recently, Hubbard told a Chronicle reporter, “Go f— youself,” and hung up.) A Tetra Tech representative challenged Smith’s credibility, saying that he has given contradictory accounts: “Mr. Smith claimed in one news report that the background sample he allegedly took was from an area adjacent to Parcel A. He now claims he took the sample directly from Parcel A.” David Anton, an attorney who represents Smith and six other Hunters Point whistle-blowers, responded that Smith “pointed the exact spot out” to a group of about 15 federal officials on a tour of the site in June 2016, when Smith told his story to representatives of the U.S. attorneys’ office, the EPA, the NRC and the Navy. Tetra Tech also argues that Smith worked for New World and other subcontractors, not for Tetra Tech directly. According to Anton, Smith reported to Tetra Tech supervisors who had the power to fire him. The Chronicle was unable to reach Smith. EPA officials said they took Smith’s claim seriously. They said they removed soil in the corridor next to Parcel A down to a depth of 2 feet. They then replaced the dirt with new, clean soil from outside the shipyard. But a one-page description of this work that the EPA provided to The Chronicle makes no mention of Smith’s cesium discovery, potential radioactive contaminants on Parcel A, or radiation testing. An EPA spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether the agency tested that soil for radiation before removing it, or performed other tests of soil in the vicinity. Parcel A is now changing by the day. Humans are transforming it in ways large and small. People have moved into condos and walk their dogs on grassy expanses that overlook the bay. The location where Smith took the sample is now an active construction area, according to Anton. The attorney said he watched during a recent visit as workers dug in the dirt, standing in holes they had carved in the earth. Mere yards away, a commercial kitchen pumps out food for people beyond the Shipyard, a fact that Wadsworth finds alarming if Parcel A remains radioactive. “Building a kitchen in an area where you’ve got contamination — how much explanation do I have to put into that?” Wadsworth said. “It just goes against the principles of radiation protection. It just does. And common sense.” The solution, Wadsworth and Bowers agree, is to finally perform a proper radiological investigation of not just Parcel A, but the entire site. “Go back and make it right,” Bowers said. “Do it the correct way this time.” And do it now, Wadsworth says, because the construction workers on Parcel A have no special clothing or gear to protect against potential radiation. If contaminants are there, workers are likely to be exposed. “Anything that gets on your hands will get around your mouth. Guys, construction workers, they will smoke, they will eat, they will also take their dirty clothes home, by their spouse, themselves, their children.” One day in February, Anton and Bowers said, they were walking near Hunters Point with Smith, looking down at the shoreline, when they noticed a dump truck. They couldn’t tell which company the truck belonged to. It seemed to be near the border of Parcel E and Parcel F, two pieces of the site that haven’t yet been cleared and where large amounts of radioactive waste have been discovered in the past. Bowers and Anton said they watched as the truck scooped wet slush from the area, then carried the mud inland toward the hillside near the newly developed condos on Parcel A. The truck stopped just above Navy Building 815, formerly a radiological laboratory that contained animal quarters and may have been the same kennel where dogs once lay dying. There the truck dumped its load, slush and concrete tumbling to the ground. The hill was now a little taller. Jason Fagone and Cynthia Dizikes are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers. Email:

 Unhappy with Pacific Steel's progress in curbing the burning-pot stench wafting from its smokestacks, the "It's not just a threat," said City Manager The city is the latest entity to try to get Pacific Steel to reduce its emissions. Last month, Pacific Steel reached a settlement with Citizens for a Better Environment to weed toxic material from its scrap metal supply and establish a committee to reduce toxic emissions by 2 tons over three years. The Bay Area Last fall, under pressure from the air district, Pacific Steel installed a carbon filter on Plant No. 3, which was supposed to dramatically reduce the smell that often permeates West Berkeley. So far, the pollution-reduction steps appear to be making progress. The air district received about 20 percent fewer complaints about Pacific Steel in 2006, said air district spokeswoman "It's not an easy process to compel a business to do what it's supposed to do," she said. "But I cannot emphasize enough how seriously the air district is taking this." Pacific Steel wants the city to be patient. The Citizens for a Better Environment plan and the air district agreement, when it's reached, will have a significant effect on emissions, said company spokeswoman "We would encourage everyone to hold off for a month or so," said Jewel. "We really don't believe most people want to see Pacific Steel and its 650 union jobs leave town." A state-funded assessment of the health risks associated with Pacific Steel is due in April. Pacific Steel is a family-owned business that has been making parts for trucks and buses in West Berkeley for about 75 years, having started when the neighborhood was predominantly heavy industry. Now it's mixed with half-million-dollar bungalows, chic shopping districts, schools and parks. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Janice+Schroeder%22">Janice Schroeder</a> "(Pacific Steel) has done some things, but I really don't feel it's enough," she said. "I don't think there's an acceptable level of toxics that people should be breathing." By revoking the permits and forcing the company to reapply for them, the city can implement tougher standards on the odors and other toxic emissions, she said, adding that no one wants the company to leave.

 Anyone who's been to West Berkeley knows the stench -- a conversation-stopping cross between burning pot handles and an engine fire. "It smells like something's wrong with your car," said That something else is The odor has become even worse since Pacific Steel Casting started making parts for the Bay Bridge reconstruction in 2002, spewing exhaust for 16 hours a day five or six days a week. But after numerous lawsuits, dozens of complaints and years of negotiations, the issue may finally be heading for a resolution. Or at least the beginning of one. In response to a suit from the Bay Area "The plant has real public health problems. They're not imagined," Wilson said. "And the filter won't solve all those problems. There's a lot of manganese, for example, that's being emitted from Pacific Steel's other two plants that already have filters." Using data provided by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Wilson deduced that the factory emits about 500 pounds of manganese a year. Manganese, in high doses, can damage the central nervous system and cause Parkinson's disease, according to the EPA. Phenol emissions, which cause the foul smells, have more than doubled since 2002. Pacific Steel Casting says it's not exactly sure what's coming from Plant No. 3 because different operations take place there. Shifting winds, emissions from places other than smokestacks and other sources of pollution -- such as the adjacent eight-lane Interstate 80 freeway, an asphalt factory, train tracks and other industry -- also make it hard to get precise data, company spokeswoman Furthermore, Pacific Steel Casting -- the nation's third largest steel foundry and employer of 500 union members -- is tired of being picked on. "They feel embattled," she said. "They feel like they're making a good-faith effort to be a good neighbor, but, realistically, they do manufacture steel in the middle of a neighborhood. They've been there since 1934 -- to anyone who moves there it shouldn't be a surprise." Pacific Steel Casting came within hours of shutting Plant No. 3 entirely a few weeks ago after an environmental group asked a judge for an injunction. The request was denied. When the company opened in 1934, West Berkeley was crowded with factories, plants and other heavy industry. But the factories gradually gave way to artists' studios, lofts and cafes, leaving Pacific Steel Casting amid a trendy shopping and residential area. Even though much of the steel industry in the United States has moved to China, Pacific Steel and its 625 workers have stayed put. "The owner is committed to staying in Berkeley. They are a healthy, $100 million company employing generations of the same family in well-paying union jobs," Jewel said. "It would be devastating if they were forced to close or move." Neighbors say they don't want Pacific Steel to move, they just want to the company to control its emissions. "We don't want them to go to another community that isn't aware of the problems," said Schroeder and other neighbors say they suffer from nausea, headaches, tightness in the chest and irritated eyes because of the smell. The city doesn't want it to leave, either. In a letter to Mayor "The big question is, what is their long-term plan?" Wilson said. "Because let's face it, emitting toxic chemicals in a dense urban environment is inappropriate and needs to be corrected."

 Caption Close Like other motorists at a Sunnyvale smog-check shop Wednesday, Fabrizio Maccioni wasn't thrilled to learn he could have saved $28 by having his car tested before Tuesday, the day a new state-mandated smog test was imposed on the Bay Area's 4.8 million auto owners. What really ground his gears was hearing that the Smog Check II test initially won't do anything different than the old test, except scan newer The real benefit won't be seen until Oct. 1, when auto shops are required to finish phasing in a treadmill-like device to simulate driving conditions that will help catch a wider array of pollutants. But some shops are already charging triple the price of the old smog check, largely to pay for the required retraining of technicians, the new computer analyzers and the treadmill-like dynamometers, which can total $50,000. "My first impression is that I'm going to be paying more for something that won't do anything different," said the San Jose software engineer as he waited to have his blue convertable Mazda Miata tested at Greenslip smog check center. But he supports the fact that stiffer tailpipe pollution standards, which Central Valley and Southern California drivers have endured for years, will cut Bay Area smog emissions by 26 tons a day in the long run. "I think it's worth the 30 bucks, if down the road it's going to help the environment," Maccioni said. The Bay Area is the last urban area in the state to face the stricter rules, because this region is in marginal violation of federal clean air standards. Central Valley lawmakers have long complained that one of the reasons for their bad air quality is the wind blowing Bay Area smog over the Altamont Pass into their communities. Last year, state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, backed legislation to end the Bay Area's exemption. In exchange, he won support from Central Valley Democrats for a bill lowering future greenhouse- gas emissions from autos. When the tougher requirement fully takes effect in October, state officials expect it to double the dirty car test failure rate to 16 percent in the nine- county region. The average statewide cost increase for the "enhanced" smog test has been about $10 -- or $45 compared with the $35 average cost for the basic test that was required in the Bay Area until Tuesday, said Rocky Carlisle, the state Bureau of Automotive Repair's coordinator for the Bay Area testing program. But he warned that some area shops are socking drivers $90 for the test -- while others offer deals as low as $18. "We strongly recommend that consumers shop around," he said. "I thought the (testing) increase was a little too high for the amount of benefit you get," said Jim Lin as he waited with his 3-year-old daughter, Nicole, while his Lexus RX 300 SUV was being tested at Greenslip. "I just hope what they're doing is really good for the environment and not just a boost for the auto repair industry," he added. Historically, Carlisle said, officials have seen a temporary price hike when a region has implemented the tougher testing. But in a competitive business driven by supply and demand, the price eventually drops as more shops make the transition to the new equipment. On the program's first day, some 60 percent of the Bay Area's 1,500 testing shops were offering the new test -- higher than the 50 percent state officials anticipated. And more than 350 shops have already installed the full analyzer- and-dynamometer system -- required to perform the complete Smog Check II testing by October. Meanwhile, smog-check operators fear their big investments will flop if rapidly evolving technology renders dynamometer testing obsolete. Other states have decided to skip the treadmill test and use the onboard diagnostic computer analysis on newer cars and stick with the basic test equipment on older cars. In Los Angeles, the state Air Resources Board is testing a wireless sensor on a taxi fleet that radios tailpipe emission information to a database a couple times a day. "We've taken the risk and we don't know if it's going to pay off," said Greenslip manager Tania Sole. "Operators are already worrying whether all this new equipment will be unnecessary in a year." But state air board spokesman Richard Varenchik said the taxi pilot project would only develop technology for new cars, and existing smog-test technology will be needed to test "this massive fleet of older cars that's going to be around for years." Not all Bay Area motorists will need the new test. Drivers who are registered in less smoggy, sparsely populated areas of the North and South Bay, coastal Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz County will still undergo the basic test. A computer checks a car's tailpipe emissions at two idling speeds. But most Bay Area residents will be required to get the new smog check every other year as part of their annual vehicle registration renewal. As part of an agreement with federal environmental regulators, the state will direct a minimum 15 percent of people who own cars deemed likely to be polluters to "test-only" smog centers that don't do repairs. The reasoning is that such shops do not have a financial stake in whether a car fails or passes, so they'll be less likely to rig the results to make a longtime customer happy. -- Effective date: July 2. -- Phase I: Newer cars' onboard computers are analyzed to detect sensor failures and other glitches that can lead to pollution and trigger test failures. -- Effectiveness: The new test won't detect perceptibly higher levels of auto emissions pollution. -- Phase II: On Oct. 1, auto shops will be required to phase in a treadmill device that simulates driving conditions and detects a wider array of pollutants. -- Effectiveness: The treadmill test is expected to result in a cut in emissions by 26 tons a day in the Bay Area. -- Cost: Starting this week, most Bay Area motorists will have to pay on average $10 more -- about $45 -- for the tougher smog test. -- Consumer tip: It pays to shop around, because some Bay Area shops are socking drivers $90 for the test -- while others offer deals as low as $18.

 Caption Close A popular Berkeley skateboarding park rated the best in the Bay Area has been closed because hexavalent chromium -- the pollutant made infamous by the movie " The opening of the long-planned park on Sept. 14 had already been delayed several months by the fall 2000 discovery of the dangerous chemical at the site, which forced a major redesign and a dramatic jump in cost to $821,000 from the original budget of $380,000. City officials say the health risk is very low and that the closure is temporary, but they are not sure when it can reopen. Parallel investigations are under way into the risk of exposure for park users and the cause of the leak, said "We're taking an overly cautious step," Caronna said of the closure, which came Dec. 27 after only 15 weeks of operation. A small amount of tan-color contaminated water -- about three cafe lattes worth -- was found to have leaked through construction joints into the bottom of the deeper bowls at the 18,000-square-foot concrete facility, Caronna said. The concentration of the chemical was 120 parts per billion in one bowl and 320 parts in another, only about one-tenth the concentration found when the chemical was detected earlier at the site, she said. State standards for drinking water permit 50 parts per billion, she said. A toxicologist consulted by the city said there was no risk to those who jumped the fence and skated through the liquid, Caronna said. A member of the citizen The park is at Fifth and Harrison streets near Interstate 80 in west Berkeley.

 Caption Close The East Oakland crematorium, when it is finally built, will incinerate some 3,000 bodies a year. Three thousand too many, says the Rev. "East Oakland is basically a dumping ground for the worst ideas in the city anyone can come up with," Buford said. "We can't seem to catch a break." The plan for the crematorium was approved without fanfare by the city in 2012. But it has since blossomed into a saga of bureaucratic intrigue, lawsuits, emergency lawmaking and neighborhood identity. At issue is the Neptune Society's plan to shutter its long-standing crematorium in Emeryville and move to an empty building at the corner of 98th Avenue and But the City Council is trying hard to stop, or at least delay, the plan. The last thing East Oakland needs, residents and elected officials agree, is more pollution and more death. "People have all these mixed images of what Oakland is, and certainly they have mixed images of East Oakland with all the violence," said What Neptune says it wants to do is grow. Its Emeryville location is too small and too old and, with Baby Boomers getting older , demand is expected to keep rising. "Our equipment and our facility are outdated, and the neighborhood has grown up around us," said After getting shut out of Richmond, Miller approached Oakland in spring of 2012 and, without controversy - or a public hearing - was issued a building permit to renovate the building and construct a crematorium capable of incinerating 3,000 bodies a year. <strong> </strong> "They took a serious look at it and in their professional judgment, they said, 'OK, you are talking about a product and you are altering it and that makes it industrial manufacturing,' " Flynn said, speaking for the planners who approved the project. "You are making a product. Not a product we all like to talk about, but a product. "Now, you can question whether that was an appropriate zoning category for this area, given its proximity to residential, and it is fair to question that," Flynn said. But the determination stands, Flynn said. Residents and city leaders were horrified to learn of the plan. Bringing what residents call an "emporium of death" to the neighborhood won't be good for business, they said. And burning bodies sends pollution and mercury from melted tooth fillings into the already polluted air of East Oakland, opponents said. "They want to put a crematorium in a district that we've been trying real hard to turn around," said Councilman While the crematorium will produce some pollution, it won't be enough to do any serious harm, said "It complies with all of the air quality laws, so we would not expect health risks to be significant," Richardson said. "We are aware that that is a neighborhood that has some particular issues when it comes to pollution, but this project does comply with our permit conditions, which are designed to keep health risk at a minimum." Days after Oakland approved the permit for the crematorium, the city passed a strict emergency law to regulate crematoriums and told Neptune to back off. Neptune sued and, in August, won. "The question before the court was: Is it a valid building permit, since Oakland law says once you're issued a permit, you're vested?" Miller said. "Laws aren't retroactive." The City Council is deciding now whether to appeal that ruling, but many people agree it may be hard to stop the process. But the whole process makes Imara skeptical. "It is not caring. We need to get back to compassion and caring," she said. "The first thing is that whatever city you live in, in order for a city to work all the community, all the workers, we're supposed to get back to that caring and compassion." Will Kane is a

 Caption Close State water quality regulators are charging the century-old C&H sugar refinery in Crockett with dumping sugar, coliform bacteria, mercury and other chemicals into the Carquinez Strait over the last three years, potentially harming fish and marine life. The more than 50 violations could cost the company as much as $500,000, depending on the findings of a hearing scheduled in February, according to the "These are older facilities, and that's what we face throughout the state - old pipes, old plants," said Regulators said 34 of the illegal discharges, 32 of which contained sugar, emanated from the plant, which uses water to cool its refining system. The remaining discharges came from storm-water runoff, a minor oil spill and from a sewage treatment plant operated by C&H and which serves the refinery and 1,100 properties in the Crockett area. No single discharge created a "serious threat" during the July 1, 2005 to Oct. 31, 2008 span, Clegern said. But continued dumping could alter the pH levels of the water, endangering fish and plants. Company officials said that after several delays they have repaired leaks in the cooling system that sent sugar into the waterway. The firm also said it installed new equipment and gave additional training to employees. "We have taken the necessary steps to ensure such delays do not occur again and no sugar-discharge violations have occurred since last February (2008)," the company said in a statement. This week's complaint was not the first for the refinery. Between September 2004 and June 2005, the water board recorded 10 violations, resulting in $30,000 in fines. At the Feb. 11 hearing, the regional water board will hear from C&H before deciding whether to amend the fine or refer it to the state attorney general's office. The company may waive the hearing by paying the full amount. In addition, C&H may be allowed to pay slightly less than $250,000 toward an environmental project such as upgrading its facilities or restoring a local habitat.

 A federal appeals court allowed prosecutors Monday to seek as much as $40 million in fines against the commercial operator of the container ship that struck the Bay Bridge in November 2007 and spilled 53,000 gallons of oil. Fleet Management Ltd. offered last month to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of negligently polluting the San Francisco Bay and killing seabirds. But the company balked when prosecutors obtained a new grand jury indictment that accused it of causing $20 million in damage, with a potential fine of as much as twice that amount. Fleet Management argued that the fine should be no more than $215,000, the maximum allowed in the indictment it faced when it first admitted guilt. But U.S. District Judge Federal prosecutors have not yet said what fine they will seek. Fleet Management's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

 <strong>2002-11-28 04:00:00 PDT San Francisco</strong> The Ninth A federal judge dismissed the suits, saying they were filed too late. But the appellate court ruled that the deadline in such cases is set by federal law, rather than a narrower California law. The difference is that California requires a suit over toxic pollution to be filed within a year of the time that the plaintiff suspects, or should suspect, the cause of the injury or illness. The federal law requires a suit within a year of the time that the plaintiff knows the cause, or should know it. That can be crucial, particularly when the disease is cancer, which can have myriad causes, said In this case, the plaintiffs alleged in their 1997 lawsuits that their illnesses -- mostly cancer -- were probably caused by radioactive and other hazardous contamination from the A federal judge dismissed the suits two years ago, saying newspaper coverage and other reports of dangerous contamination from the site should have put the plaintiffs on notice long before a 1997 UCLA study found a greater risk of cancer among some Rocketdyne employees. But the appeals court, in a 2-1 ruling, said it wasn't clear whether the plaintiffs even knew about the publicity; or, if they did, whether they should have known that the contamination was the likely cause of their illnesses, as opposed to other causes. Those factual disputes should be decided by a jury, the court said.

 <strong>2000-01-05 04:00:00 PDT DALY CITY</strong> More than two dozen people representing Midway Village held up signs and blocked the entrance to a Pacific Gas and Electric Co. construction site during a morning rain. The power company is overturning contaminated soil, which many residents hold responsible for a slew of health problems suffered by the project's 150 low- income families. Some of the dirt and groundwater being dug up is known to contain the carcinogen polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, or PNAs. Protesters say the pollutant is also buried beneath residents' homes and in nearby Bayshore Park, giving Midway Village residents tumors, breathing problems, bloody noses, rashes and other illnesses. Lula Bishop, whose home sits only about 10 feet away from the construction site, woke up with feelings of nausea yesterday morning after breathing fumes she said have come from the site since workers began excavation. "We're in a medical emergency," said Bishop, who has lived in Midway Village since 1977. "Our kids are getting sick. They have rashes our doctors can't explain. We suffer from cancers. Something has to be done." The county built the housing complex in 1976 on a parcel of land that included the site of a former PG&E plant, which had deposited coal tar and soot into the soil before closing in 1913. PG&E found the waste in 1980 and a decade later notified county officials that the soil near Midway Village was polluted with suspected carcinogens.

At Bayshore Park, a 10-foot fence was also erected to keep people from getting too close to the excavation. The project, which got under way in mid-October, was originally to be completed in three to four weeks, Wanger said. The agency has been forced to push back the completion date in part because of the continuing protests, he said, noting that pickets have blocked trucks sent in to haul away the toxic soil. State officials also offered to temporarily relocate residents who live directly adjacent to the construction site. But of 16 families eligible for the transfer, only two volunteered to move, said Some Midway Village residents said the offer was too little, too late. For years now, they have been seeking compensation for their ailments and are asking to be permanently moved from the area. They also want any medical expenses incurred as a result of the toxic soil paid for by those responsible. Demonstrators hope the protest -- the seventh such action in the past few weeks -- will keep the spotlight on the residents' drawn- out battle with PG&E and the county Housing Authority over the soil. Officials have shown "a callous disregard for the health and well- being of those who live here," said Midway Village residents "are prisoners of their low-income status," he said. "If this were a rich, white community, do you think they'd be forced to live on toxic soil for generations?"

At Lake Shasta, a toxic algae bloom has prompted the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board to issue a warning against using the Pit River Arm of of the lake for recreation activities. The good news, is Shasta Lake, after years of drought, now has plenty of water. The bad news is, you shouldn't swim in it or boat on it. At least not in the Pit River Arm of the lake. Cyanobacteria, a toxic blue-green algae that could endanger your health, is spreading in the area. The The algae bloom can appear as pea green with light streaks or sometimes with blueish tints. It also gathers in slimy mats and brown or white foam. Exposure to cyanobacteria can cause skin rashes, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- or flu-like symptoms. Children and pets are particularly susceptible. Dogs should not be allowed to drink the tainted water. Boiling algae water does not remove the toxins. Eating fish caught in the lake is not recommended, but if you do, be sure that all the guts and liver are removed and that the meat is flushed with clean water.

 <strong>1999-11-23 04:00:00 PDT BAY AREA</strong> Environmentalists said yesterday that the new proposals, contained in a November 12 letter concerning the Tosco refinery near Martinez, indicates a major policy shift by the federal government on acceptable levels of pollutants in the bay. Petroleum industry officials criticized the proposals, saying refineries and other industries could be forced to spend millions of dollars for plant improvements that might not yield significant environmental benefits. In a letter calling for tighter future permit restrictions for Tosco, EPA officials said a complete prohibition on the release of dioxin and other chemicals that accumulate in animal tissues may be needed to halt environmental damage to the bay. Although the letter concerns only one permit, environmental advocates said the EPA statement is a milestone whose reasoning applies to all companies discharging wastewater into the bay that contains dioxin and certain other pollutants. The letter by But Strauss said a zero-discharge standard may be necessary if a study of the entire watershed shows that further releases of dioxin would violate federal standards and make bay fish unsafe to eat. Because there are no data showing how each plant could be permitted to discharge an allotted level of dioxin that would be harmless to the environment, Strauss said, the only possible standard is "a loading of zero." "You can bet every deep-water discharger is looking at this letter, and they see a change in the tide," said Although the EPA set no schedule for watershed studies that might dictate new discharge limits, environmental groups said the agency's stand gives them ammunition to push for swift restrictions on dioxin releases. Scott Folwarkow, a spokesman for the Folwarkow said the EPA stand could force oil companies and other industries to spend millions on pollution controls that might not yield significant benefits. "We're talking about getting down to levels below detectable limits," Folwarkow said. Tosco's dioxin discharges have the source of controversy since 1995, when the regional water board issued a cease and desist order against the company for violating permit limits. Tosco is currently trying to meet requirements to get the permit renewed. Now, for the first time, regulatory agencies will collect actual data instead of depending on projections to determine how much dioxin is being released and where it comes from, said After the EPA declared in May that dioxin had already seriously damaged water quality and posed a health risk to anglers and others who eat fish from polluted bay waters, a Bay Area congressional delegation and government leaders from San Francisco and Oakland joined BayKeeper and Communities for a Better Environment in the call for more stringent dioxin standards. "A lot of people have been saying there should be dioxin elimination," Karras said. "This is the first time a public health agency with the power to enforce it has said so." EPA engineer But dischargers will have to contribute data and help finance studies to determine how much of each pollutant they release, Liden said. In the meantime, they will have to explore such methods as changing their manufacturing processes so they can meet stricter limits in the future. "I would be surprised if it did not contribute to an improvement in the cleanliness of the bay 10 years from now," Liden said. The EPA's letter on Tosco's water discharge permit may intensify a running conflict with the <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Wil+Bruhns%22">Wil Bruhns</a> "The language gets negotiated," Bruhns said. "EPA's letter will certainly be a strong factor in the negotiations." In an earlier letter objecting to Tosco's permit, the EPA also proposed the eventual elimination of a "dilution credit" that allows Tosco and other deep-water dischargers to release 10 times the standard for dioxin releases on the assumption that the chemical becomes less harmful as it spreads out in the water in lower concentrations. But the EPA said that because the water may already be beyond acceptable limits for dioxin and other harmful chemicals, no dilution credits should be allowed. Karras said the EPA's position on dioxin will also apply to sewage plants, water treatment facilities, power plants and other dischargers. He said the environmental group has developed technical plans to show that refineries and other facilities can comply with strict dioxin limits within a few years. Dioxin, one of the most toxic chemicals ever made, is produced when chlorine is burned and combines with organic chemicals. It was the primary ingredient of the defoliant Agent Orange used by the U.S. armed services in Vietnam. Dioxin is linked to a host of serious health problems including diabetes, reproductive disorders, immune system suppression, endometriosis, cancer and learning difficulties. Dioxin becomes concentrated in the fatty tissues of animals, such as the fish eaten by subsistence anglers in the Bay. Dioxin also accumulates in the breast tissues of nursing mothers, whose infants then absorb the toxic substance through breast milk. About three grams of dioxin is estimated to flow into the bay annually, although no one knows exactly how much. Tosco, for example, is allowed to discharge 0.14 trillionths of a gram per liter, roughly equivalent to a microscopic speck on a teaspoon in every quart of water Tosco releases.

A sheen of oil - as well as a strong odor - remained on the water and the beach. He said the warm weather would help to evaporate the remaining oil. Three Dotters, a 50-foot boat, was punctured when the cradle hauling it up the beach gave way. It was still lying on its side Saturday and was scheduled to be lifted with a crane Sunday morning. The county posted warnings to beachgoers along a half-mile stretch of Half Moon Bay that the area had been contaminated. Temko said the actual spill area affected about 500 yards along Princeton Beach. The Coast Guard called in an outside company to set up booms and absorbent pads to soak up the spilled fuel. The boat contained about 2,400 gallons of fuel in five tanks, Temko said. The punctured tank contained an estimated 300 to 500 gallons. A representative of the state A boat in dry dock at Pier 70 in San Francisco spilled 8,400 gallons of fuel into the Bay last October, triggering a massive cleanup.

 <strong>1998-08-17 04:00:00 PDT TRACY</strong > But now state environmentalists are trying to figure out what to do with the melting glob of black goo at the One possibility is turning the 30-acre tire pit into a landfill, said Another option is to clean the mess up and truck it to a dump elsewhere. Spagnole said he does not know how much it will cost to turn the site into a landfill, but he said it would cost about $3 million to clear the greasy pit. Whatever the plans, Spagnole said he wants to make sure the owner of the pile, "The experts will have to see which is the safest, most cost-effective alternative," he said. The smelly, spewing fire is viewed as an ominous reminder of how difficult it is to get rid of the rubber doughnuts. The state has an existing stockpile of 30 million tires -- and 32 million more may be tossed into the heap by the end of the year, said But tires are banned from most landfills because they pop back to the surface. Instead, the state is backing aggressive recycling programs. In shredded form, tires can be used for rubber asphalt, playground covering and sandal soles, and they can be turned into usable energy. Regulators say they are being single-minded about their attempts to get rid of the tire mounds because of the environmental and fire hazards they pose. The fire in Tracy reportedly began after an employee caused a spark while clearing weeds. So far, toxic contamination is slight. A steady breeze has swept the acrid plume away from nearby homes, minimizing its harmful effects. However, health officials are warning residents to wash, not wipe, the black grime that lands in yards and coats homes and Meanwhile, a team of scientists have been prodding the earth around the smoldering pile, testing for harmful contaminants. Because the fire was allowed to burn, not doused with water, a soup of pyrolytic oils left behind will likely be too thick to penetrate a wall of clay protecting the ground water table, Spagnole said. Without the water, the oils pool on the surface or do not leach far into the dirt. Spagnole said Royster did not have a permit to operate the pile -- and that regulators have been trying to get him in compliance for four years. By law, owners cannot stack tires higher than 10 feet, and they must stack them in groups, creating a path between piles for fire fighting. Also, owners must have a reserve tank of water on site in the event of a fire. Royster, 66, had none of those, claiming that his collection of 7 million tires existed long before the new regulations, Spagnole said. The businessman, who was indicted on Friday in three felony counts of bankruptcy fraud in an unrelated matter, could not be reached for comment. His pile has become the largest in the state, since the The most disastrous tire fire in history happened in Winchester, Va., in July 1984. The blaze burned for nine months, consuming 5 to 7 million tires, polluting the air in four states and contaminating the groundwater. Firefighters showered the pit with water, responding as they would to any fire. But they soon learned that tire fires are different. "Water doesn't really cut through the fire and creates more of a thinner liquid (causing more health risks)," Spagnole said. "We learned to just let them burn."

 Black smoke billowed out of a flaring East Bay oil refinery after a unit went down on Tuesday, causing officials to issue a health advisory for people living in the area that lasted more than an hour. Around 11:45 a.m., the Martinez Refinery Flare Prompts Contra Costa Health Advisory “Steam is what powers the entire refinery,” Deutsche said Tuesday. “If steam is all of a sudden reduced, the oil can thicken up and build up pressure. It can be dangerous to the entire process.” Equipment used to refine oil began to flare up and cause smoke as a result of losing the steam generation unit, Deutsche said. A lack of steam threw the system out of whack and created black smoke, a result of burning hydrocarbons that would usually be processed in the refining cycle. Officials with the health department and Bay Area About 12:20 p.m., A “level 2 incident” was called by health officials, meaning people with preexisting respiratory problems off-site from the plant could experience breathing problems from the smoke. A hazardous materials team was sent to the refinery to assess the health risk, Balladares said. The warning, issued for Martinez, Pacheco, North Concord and Clyde, also stated those in the area could experience eye, skin, nose, or throat irritation. Officials lifted the advisory shortly before 2 p.m. and the steam generation unit was put “back on line,” Deutsche said. Some units remain down, but the steam generation unit is operating. An investigation of the incident was ongoing, officials said. “There were no injuries as a result of this event,” Deutsche said in a statement. “We do not expect any adverse health effects... Our main priority is to safely return the refinery to normal operations and to minimize the impact to the community and the environment.” In August,

 Caption Close Building 1,330 high-rise dwellings on land once named one of the most toxic sites in the Bay Area might sound crazy, but that's what a Marin developer wants to do near the popular Point Isabel Regional Shoreline in Richmond. Not only that, he wants to rely on fans -- powered by bay breezes -- to pipe away fumes released from chemicals dumped in the ground decades ago. As workers prepare to dig up a polluted marsh next to the site this week, the proposed development is drawing fire. Opponents say it is dangerous and that state watchdogs are asleep at the switch -- so they've enlisted the help of Contra Costa County's public health chief and an attorney who usually represents the developers of such sites . "This is beyond the pale. It's irresponsible," said But Richmond redevelopment officials don't think the plan is crazy at all. They note that several Bay Area developers have successfully built and sold homes on once-polluted land, from the nearby Marina Bay development to former military bases in Alameda and Novato. The Richmond plan includes construction of townhouses. Because there is a risk of carcinogenic vapors from the ground below, builders would build vented crawlspaces underneath the dwellings and install pipes to carry fumes out through the roof. The vapors would be pushed through the pipes by wind-powered turbines. "It's an absolute outrage to tell people that, 'Yeah, there are a lot of volatile organic compounds in the ground, but we'll have fans to whisk those away,' " Weiner said. Developer City redevelopment officials agree, saying high-density housing is an ideal use for land with such picturesque bay views. They praise Pitto for initiating a $6 million cleanup of wetlands surrounding the San Francisco Bay Trail, marshes that will be protected as habitat under the management of the East Bay Regional Parks District. Opponents are fighting the proposal on many fronts. Some argue that bringing in 3,000 new residents will threaten endangered clapper rail birds. Others complain that 18-story high-rises will block views. But questions about possible danger to people have attracted the attention of Contra Costa County's public health officer, Dr. The project cannot move forward with an environmental impact report until the But last month, Brunner asked the state's Environmental Protection Agency to transfer oversight to the Last week, the EPA wrote Brunner that there will be a meeting about the issue soon. For now, the water board is the lead, and department scientists have been asked to help evaluate the plan. But Brunner said the matter is more urgent because the developer will begin restoring the marsh on Wednesday. Pitto, a fourth-generation San Franciscan, said Campus Bay will be a safe and vibrant community where people want to live. He has complied with all the requests of state regulators thus far, and he said he will abide by whatever changes to design they might require. No one disputes that the 85-acre area at the center of the controversy has a history of toxicity. The The company later expanded its operations, developing and manufacturing fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. The plant -- which through corporate mergers came to be owned by Zeneca Corp. in the 1980s -- closed in 1997. The land was so polluted that in 1998 the state water board named it a toxic "hot spot" -- one of the 10 most polluted sites in the Bay Area. In 2002, Zeneca spent $20 million to neutralize acidic soils, haul away contaminated dirt and cap the land to seal in any remaining toxins. Zeneca sold the land to Pitto's State water regulators said the land was safe for industrial use. Zeneca had used research-and-development labs on some 20 or so acres that are now rented out as a business park. Pitto plans to build more R&D office space on the remaining 40-plus acres where the land had been cleared and capped. But the Environmental standards are much higher for homes than for industrial areas, because children and the elderly will be present 24 hours a day. In Campus Bay, the groundwater and soil still contain volatile organic chemicals that could escape from the ground in gas form, especially if cracks ever develop in the cap. Exposure to these chemicals has been associated with a range of human health problems, from throat irritation and nausea to central-nervous-system damage and cancers. Environmental consultants say removal of the chemicals would be too expensive, would take as long as 10 years and might not work over the long term. Instead, they propose to use "engineering controls" to reduce the risk of toxic vapors ever affecting future residents. Homes would be built over open breezeways or ventilated garages. Bay winds and fans would be used to blow any accumulating toxic vapors away. "We think it is pretty clear on a technical level that there won't be any real exposure to vapors," said Still, the use of wind-powered turbines or fans to propel fumes out of living spaces is unusual, said "That's something new for us," said Cook. "We haven't seen that." Her staff is currently researching the issue, she said. The fate of homes is undecided, but the water board has approved the restoration of 22 acres of marshes nearby. The scars left by nearly a century of pollution there are clear -- most visibly in the form of a red-orange pond reflecting the color of iron pyrite cinders dumped there. Opponents say that while they think the marsh desperately needs to be cleaned up, they have little confidence it will be done safely. Among them is The company was permitted to monitor the cleanup and used only one air quality monitor -- installed behind a building where the wind was blocked -- to check for toxic air pollution, she said. Padgett admits her interest in the issue is personal. Last year, a rare tumor called a chondroma, a precursor to bone cancer, was diagnosed, and Padgett had surgery to remove four ribs and part of her sternum. This summer, a different kind of rare tumor in her thyroid was diagnosed, she said. "I don't know if it is related," Padgett said. "But there was no governmental agency out there protecting us, 24 hours a day, during the dismantling of one of the most toxic sites in the state of California."

Temperatures exceeding 100 degrees are expected through Thursday in inland areas, and may hit 110 in the hottest Bay Area valleys. Relief isn't likely until the weekend. Even San Francisco will see temperatures top out in the mid-80s, according to the The heat wave is already in full swing inland. It hit 104 degrees today in Livermore, 103 in Concord and 101 in Morgan Hill. At Lake Berryessa, the high was 109.

 Caption Close Earth Day may have been Saturday, but that didn’t stop volunteers from showing up at Ocean Beach on Sunday morning to participate in the Surfrider Foundation’s annual Earth Day beach cleanup. Three stations along Ocean Beach — at Stairwell 17, Noriega Street and Sloat Boulevard — welcomed a total of about 250 volunteers on Sunday morning. The Outer Sunset day was bright, sunny and brutally windy. Surfrider, a nonprofit group devoted to coastal defense, provided gloves, trash pickers and buckets, and volunteers set out to collect as much debris as they could find on the shores. Afterward, Surfrider hosted a block party on 45th Avenue with live music, barbecue and beers poured by local breweries Woods and Calicraft. Each year, Earth Day helps Surfrider shout its message a little louder, but organizing beach cleanups is business as usual for the organization, which holds three cleanup days every month. Though many San Franciscans may not realize it, pollution and waste throughout the entire city have big impacts on the water quality of the coastline. For example, trash thrown into the bay on the city ’s eastern side gets flushed by currents through the Golden Gate, where eddies throw the debris into the ocean. “Every time we have a cleanup, we collect at least 40 to 50 pounds of trash,” said Max Ernst, chairman of Surfrider’s San Francisco chapter. Surfrider was founded in 1984 in Malibu, when a group of surfers formed a coalition to protest development plans along the beach where they surfed. The foundation now counts 80 chapters nationwide, focusing on grassroots organizing; the San Francisco chapter has about 50 active volunteers, and a larger network of 2,500 in the city. “It’s easy in San Francisco to be disconnected from the beach, because we don’t usually get that ‘Let’s go hang out at the beach all day’ weather,” Ernst said. Many of Surfrider’s programs here are dedicated to preempting the cycle of waste that leads to beach pollution: campaigns against single-use plastic, for example, and efforts to put cigarette ash cans around the city, so that those materials later don’t end up in the ocean. “The goal is to educate,” Ernst said, “which hopefully mitigates the problem on the front end.” In addition to pollution, another big focus for Surfrider is coastal erosion, and it is trying to push local government to implement a managed retreat solution. Many volunteers Sunday morning had dogs in tow; even more had their children. At the Stairwell 17 station, across from the Beach Chalet restaurant, corporate and school groups came in droves. Last week, LinkedIn and Salesforce both sponsored employee-led cleanups through Surfrider. As volunteers returned to the stations, their buckets teeming with garbage, some seemed surprised at the scale of waste they’d encountered. They’d found cardboard boxes, pillows and blankets, six-packs of beer, huge slabs of wood. “It’s hard to see the pollution at Ocean Beach all the time, because the water moves so much here,” Ernst said. And most beachgoers don’t realize that Ocean Beach is a national park, part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, just like Muir Woods and Lands End. “If everyone knew they were entering a national park,” Ernst said, “they might treat it differently.” Surfrider hopes its efforts help make that status more visible. “When people see you coming by to pick up trash, maybe they think twice about leaving it on the beach,” said David Martinez, one of Surfrider’s active year-round volunteers. Ocean pollution affects all of San Francisco in myriad ways — by contaminating the fish that we eat, for instance — but, of course, the surfers who flock to Ocean Beach’s swelling waters experience it up close and personal every day. That intimate relationship with the ocean is at the heart of why Surfrider volunteers do what they do. “You don’t have to be a surfer to be involved,” Ernst said. “But it just so happens that surfers usually share the sense of responsibility. By being on the ground, you’re able to see what issues affect the local community.” Esther Mobley is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email:

 Caption Close Treasure Island resident But when a group of Navy contractors dug a small radioactive fragment out of her front yard last month, Lundgren became angry and scared. The fragment, a metal disc the size of a dime, was detected during radiation scans conducted in November but wasn't dug up until the end of January. The Navy didn't give a reason for the delay. During that time, Lundgren attended two meetings where city, state and federal officials repeatedly assured residents that the island is safe and that the scans were merely precautionary measures. It wasn't the first time radioactive fragments have been found near her home - another two were dug up last spring. The disc found in January is just the latest in a string of radiological revelations by state and federal officials in charge of cleaning up the former military base, which will eventually be transferred to the city of San Francisco and redeveloped. The Navy believes the radiation is left over from the decontamination of radioactive ships and from dials, gauges and deck markers left behind from a time when the miliary used radioactive paint to make things glow in the dark. Residents and others familiar with the contamination issues at Treasure Island say the discoveries - combined with other toxics known to pollute the island's soil since before residents were moved there in 1999 - raise questions about whether San Francisco should have moved people there in the first place, before the island was clean, and whether it should have allowed them to live there during the cleanup. While government agencies have repeatedly determined that the radiation and other toxics don't pose a health risk, residents say they have not been kept up to date on the cleanup and don't trust the safety declarations. Lundgren, who has repeatedly told city, state and federal officials she is concerned for her family's and neighbors' safety, said she is shocked that no one has contacted her or her neighbors to explain what was found last month. She is ready to move. "I have sat in meetings since they obviously knew it was there, and they looked me dead in the face and told me there was no way we would be around (radiation)," said Lundgren, who has lived on the island since 2006. " The place where they found that device, because it's by the kitchen window, I used to keep the window open and the kids would sit out there and do math and chalk and art. ... I am so angry. If I hadn't been home, who would have told me?" Bob Beck, development manager for the Beck said the Navy identified three "elevated" radiation readings during its recent round of scans, but all were low compared with some of the tests conducted earlier in 2013. He said the city doesn't want to scare people by telling them about every radiological discovery if it's not deemed a health risk by experts. "The items detected and excavated were concluded not to be significant. Do we saturate the people with information about this stuff - ' We found something, but never mind'?" he asked. Supervisor "I think when you are the expert ... there is a level of insensitivity you have to the average layperson; and people's fears, especially when you have kids, are totally legitimate," she said. "I don't think their questions and concerns have always been addressed the way they want them to be." In a city where the safety of fake grass playfields became a major source of debate and a city agency is in part dedicated to helping consumers steer away from toxic products, it's surprising that there's not more alarm on the part of city officials, Lundgren said. She and many residents say their families, and kids in particular, are suffering from health issues they cannot explain, and worry they will develop medical problems later in life. All of Lundgren's children - ages 13, 16 and 17 - have developed chronic health conditions in recent years, she said, including lupus-like symptoms in her middle daughter, Praise. Her husband, Eric, went into heart failure in 2006, she said, after attempting to put down Astroturf in their backyard to keep the dust from getting inside. Lundgren said authorities keep assuring residents they are taking every precaution to ensure residents' safety, but do not come clean about new discoveries until they are forced to by observant residents or media reports. "When do I get to use precaution for my family? When am I going to be informed enough so that I can be proactive for my kids? " she asked. "I just think they are not going to tell us the truth - they are absolutely going to stick to their story - and every time we catch them on something they are either deadly silent or want to evade the question entirely." Lundgren hasn't always felt this way. For years, she, like many of her neighbors, felt blessed to have the opportunity to live in such a spot. Treasure Island - with its sweeping views of the bay, Marin and San Francisco; its small-town feel; and its affordable three- and four-bedroom rental homes - is an anomaly in the Bay Area. When it became available, the city jumped at the opportunity to relocate people there. Starting in 1999, under Mayor But Navy cleanup efforts have taken longer than anticipated, in part because of the unexpected discoveries of radiological materials, starting in 2007 and continuing into this year. State health officials have raised questions about whether there are other, unknown sources of contamination. Among the places where elevated radiation levels were discovered was the soil under a playground in the housing area. That playground remains open, because the state determined in 2012 that there was no exposure risk, said Saunders. Last March, radioactive fragments and soil with elevated radiation levels were discovered in five separate places in the housing area - including the two fragments near Lundgren's home. Contact with one of the fragments, health officials wrote, could cause "radiation burns, hair loss and possible ulceration." Radiation under the 93-acre housing is not the only potential health risk. Before residents moved in, the Navy and city knew that the land under the island's housing area, known as Site 12, was a former waste disposal site and that many of the half-century-old homes contain lead paint and asbestos. Not long after residents were moved there, the Navy also discovered that parts of the housing area had been used as a burn pit after the Golden Gate International Exposition, the 1939-40 world's fair for which the island was built. From the beginning, lease agreements have barred residents from digging in their yards or altering the landscaping because of the arsenic, pesticides, lead, PCBs and other chemicals on a long list of known toxic materials left over in the dirt from the Navy's trash pit under portions of the housing area. But some residents said that prohibition wasn't made clear to them, and public health experts say it's ridiculous to expect children not to play in the dirt. "You can tell people not to dig in the garden, but kids dig - they do a lot of hand-to-mouth activity," said Beck said the city believes it has been clear about those restrictions but wants to "start doing more" ongoing notifications on the issue. Lundgren, for example, is worried that her kids may have dug up something potentially dangerous when they were younger. Praise, her 16-year-old daughter, recently told her that she and her two siblings used to save items they found in the dirt near their house. The family has been searching their home to make sure they aren't still around. Morello-Frosch also raised questions about having vulnerable people, such as children, living near cleanup work, since soil and dust can easily move around "and remediation activity itself could be leading to short-term exposure." Over the years, the "Fencing it off doesn't keep soil from moving ... and to assume that residents adjacent to sites where soil is being remediated aren't being exposed isn't so clear. The question is how much," Morello-Frosch said. "To do that right next to where kids play and people are living is not a great idea." Beck said the Navy has been extremely careful to monitor air quality during cleanup work and that the concerns raised by state health officials are evidence that the regulatory system is working as it should. "One of the reasons the cleanup has taken as long as it should is before the Navy does anything they need to prepare very detailed work plans to address the measures they are taking to control dust," he said, adding that the city "does rely on parents and households" to make sure kids aren't playing in the dirt. Not everyone has been reassured, however. The Boys and Girls Club of San Francisco had concerns about having kids near a cleanup site and in November decided to shutter its Treasure Island center until the work is over. Until its closure, the center was next to a fenced-off area plastered with contamination signs that for months was covered with piles of dirt topped with green dust-control spray. Nearby is another plot of deep pits filled with water. Across the way are a playground and several playfields that are packed on weekends; nearby are a church and day care center, which remain open. Saul Bloom, whose nonprofit Arc Ecology conducts environmental research and helps communities deal with pollution, said he's become increasingly alarmed at the situation on the island. He sat on the committee that advised the city when it was considering moving people onto Treasure Island in the 1990s and said the island was thought to be far less contaminated at the time. As the extent of contamination - radiological and otherwise - has become more evident, and the uses of Treasure Island increased, his concern has grown, he said. Now, thousands of people attend concerts and sporting and other events there every year, go to the wineries that have set up shop, and visit the yacht club and dozens of other businesses located on the island. He wouldn't let his kids play there, he said. "It became clear to me that any reasonable person would begin to question the degree to which the property is safe, given the broad-based uses," Bloom said. "All restraint was lost in terms of how they are using the facility." Saunders, the Navy spokesman, said the Navy "has been supportive of the city of San Francisco's request to continue its leasing program with the first priority of ensuring protection of human health and the environment." Bloom said he's also concerned about the lack of any sort of watchdog agency, noting that the city has a vested interest in moving development of the property forward as quickly as possible - and protecting itself legally. Residents, particularly low-income families, have nowhere else to go, he said, and the city has refused to conduct any sort of health risk assessment on the residents, saying that the population isn't big enough. Lenny Siegel of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight - which promotes public oversight of environmental cleanups - said it's not unusual for regulators to downplay potential health risks. "The tendency among regulatory agencies is to assure people," said Siegel, who has not been involved in the Treasure Island cleanup. " A lot of regulators err on the side of too much reassurance ... and regulators fight over what needs to be cleaned up, but people have a right to make their own risk management decisions and need to be informed so they can make those decisions." Siegel said he would think twice before living - or playing - somewhere with that type of soil contamination, because dust can blow anywhere. "It sounds to me like they moved people out there too quickly. ... It probably has to do with the frustration of how long it takes to make a base OK for use," he said. Beck, however, insisted that the city's first priority is the safety of the public. "All the information we have ... is that it is safe to be here and to live here," he said. "Certainly we, the city, would not want to keep people in conditions we feel are unsafe. ... There's no upside to putting people at risk." Marisa Lagos is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

 Caption Close Children at an Oakland elementary school have been exposed to water with lead levels four times higher than allowed under federal guidelines, test results obtained Thursday by The Chronicle show. The temporary site of Glenview Elementary School near the Emeryville border was one of seven sites in the Oakland Unified School District where contamination levels of the toxic metal in water exceeded federal health standards. The district began testing school taps in August in advance of new state requirements, but the results have not been well-publicized. Administrators at some of the schools with contaminated water said they had only recently been informed of the findings, and even the city’s school board president heard the news Thursday from a Chronicle reporter. Oakland has tested 47 of the district’s 87 school sites. Besides the temporary Glenview site, contamination levels exceeded federal standards at Thornhill, Brookfield, Fruitvale, Joaquin Miller and Burckhalter elementary schools, as well as American Indian Charter High School on the former Lakeview Elementary campus. Officials say the water flowing into the schools is safe. The problem is in the plumbing — there is lead in the fixtures and pipe solders, and it leaches into the water. The worst water was found in a kitchen tap at the temporary Glenview school on 54th Street, where 430 children are attending classes while the Glenview campus in the Oakland hills undergoes renovation. The amount of lead in the tap totaled 60 parts per billion, four times the federally recommended maximum of 15 parts per billion, according to tests done by the school district. That faucet and taps at the other six school sites with high levels of lead were taken out of use after officials learned the test results, said district spokeswoman Valerie Goode. But as of Thursday, the district was still working on telling parents about the health issue. “Those are efforts we’re trying to ensure are completed,” Goode said. “There are still schools on that list that have parents that don’t know.” It appeared district officials rushed to inform parents after The Chronicle contacted them about the test results. Parents at Burckhalter, Joaquin Miller and Fruitvale were notified Thursday, either by letter or automated phone call. Thornhill parents were also notified, Thomas Vaquerano, whose child attends the school, said in an email. He did not say when he had been told. District officials said Glenview parents were informed Sept. 21 about the lead in the water at the school’s temporary site, which was once the home of the now-closed Santa Fe Elementary School. It was unclear whether parents at the other two schools had been informed. Efforts to reach parents and administrators were unsuccessful. One person who had not been told was James Harris, the school board president. “That’s crazy,” Harris said, responding to a reporter’s question about the lead levels, adding he needed to call Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammel. “But now I’m about to know.” Harris later said the district is working to address the lead issue. It wasn’t immediately clear where the lead was found at some of the schools. At Joaquin Miller, Principal Sara Green said it was found in a kitchen faucet that is not used for drinking. The letter to Glenview parents said the kitchen tap there where high levels were found dispensed water used to wash fruits and vegetables. Exposure to lead even in low levels can harm children’s health, possibly damaging the brain and nervous system, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Let’s be clear. There’s no safe level of lead for our kids,” said Jason Pfeifle, public health advocate for CalPIRG, a consumer advocate group. “The district should notify parents about these results immediately and take strong action to prevent any further lead exposures.” The district started testing water taps after concerns were raised last school year about lead in the water at McClymonds High School, where a shower in the boys locker room dispensed water exceeding the federal threshold for the metal. Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation this month requiring all schools to test faucets for lead by 2019. A number of districts signed up for a voluntary testing program launched in January, with local water utilities conducting the tests. Oakland officials conducted the testing independently. Of the 1,100 schools statewide that received results as of early October, 35 posted high levels of lead, said the State Water Resources Control Board. They included schools in the Jefferson Elementary School District in San Mateo County and Foothills Adventist Elementary, a private school in Napa County, as well as the California School for the Blind in Fremont San Francisco Unified also received results this month, showing three schools had high levels of lead: West Portal and Malcolm X elementary schools and San Francisco International High School. The district has tested 72 of San Francisco’s 124 sites. In Oakland, officials are continuing to test taps across the district. They have also asked the East Bay Municipal Utility District to conduct additional tests at all the schools. It’s still unclear how significant — and expensive — the lead problem will be, Oakland officials said. “With our budget the way it is, we’re going to have to find a way to make these replacements,” said Goode, the district spokeswoman. “That is a concern that we will need to figure out how to solve once we know how large of a situation we have.” Jill Tucker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: <strong>Too much lead</strong> Seven schools in Oakland were found to have lead levels exceeding the federal recommendation of 15 parts per billion: Glenview Elementary (at the Santa Fe campus): 60 ppb Burckhalter Elementary: 30.8 ppb Joaquin Miller Elementary: 21.2 ppb Brookfield Elementary: 20.4 ppb American Indian Charter High (Lakeview Elementary campus): 17.3 ppb Fruitvale Elementary: 16.3 ppb Thornhill Elementary: 15.9 ppb

 <strong>1995-01-08 04:00:00 PDT MARIN COUNTY; SAN RAFAEL</strong> Noble, 48, lives on one acre, just minutes from busy U.S. 101. Called Los Ranchitos, his neighborhood, with horses, sheep and geese, is unlike any other in this suburban community. Noble and other residents of the area, which is across the highway from the Their fight boils down to the merits of septic systems versus sewers. About 100 of the 166 homes in the 1950s-era neighborhood are on septic systems. County and sewer officials say many are leaking, posing a health hazard and polluting area creeks and the Bay. The county's former health officer declared the area a "public health nuisance and health hazard" in a January 1993 memo. But septic proponents maintain the switch is unnecessary, too costly and would lead to subdivision of the large lots, threatening the rural way of life. They recently lost a lawsuit against county and sewer officials in Marin Superior Court, but may appeal. "I'd like to see it stay much as it was 20 to 30 years ago," Noble says of the neighborhood, where he grew up and has remained to raise his young child. "There's nothing wrong with septic tanks." <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Sandy+Levitan%22">Sandy Levitan</a> Septic proponents say sewer connections will cost homeowners up to $40,000 each. But like everything else in the controversy, that point is in dispute. Sewer supporters contend the cost is half that. Controversy aside, Levitan speaks eloquently about life in her secluded, hillside home, with a view of the landmark "When I look outside, I see squirrels running along the railing of my deck," Levitan says. "They drink, they eat and live here. I live in their world and they live in my world." Levitan says she maintains her septic system and it works well. "I don't like the idea of somebody coming and telling me, "We don't care that yours is working. Others don't and you have to pay for it.' " But Septic advocates say their own soils expert concluded that those systems with problems could be repaired. The controversy has divided the neighborhood. About 13 years ago, 20 homeowners formed their own assessment district to connect to sewers. A year ago, 28 others followed suit. Earl Van Note, a horseman who is part of the Marin County Sheriff's Posse, helped form the assessment district for the 28 homes to join Las Gallinas Valley Sanitary District. Van Note, 75, said he got fed up when sewage from a neighbor's leach field drained onto his property. "You just can't believe how bad (the smell) was," he says. "I'd open the back door to feed my horse - it was unbelievable." He wrote letters complaining to county and regional officials. Noble and The STEP systems work well for 10 homes in Portola Valley, said But Eddings wishes the controversy would just go away. "It has taken neighbors and turned them into enemies. Those are things that can never be corrected," he says.&lt;

 Caption Close A Marin County subdivision where home buyers have been warned of underground MTBE contamination has halted some construction because explosive methane gas from an old military dump is seeping up near home sites. Although workers are putting the final touches on 80 newly built homes, construction of dozens more have been put on hold while air tests are conducted at Hamilton Meadows at the former site of Hamilton "There's been some indication that the methane gas is migrating toward our property" from the former dump, said However, he added, recent tests of unoccupied homes have shown no evidence that the highly flammable gas has entered any homes. "We are trying to be proactive to make sure that the residents are being protected," said Gamble, who has hired a consultant to monitor the air in the homes. Almost one-third of 235 planned homes at Hamilton Meadows have been built, and more than a dozen have been occupied. As part of the final two phases, houses will be built closer to both the former dump -- located 200 feet from the closest home sites -- and a toxic plume of MTBE in the groundwater. None of the current residents must move, Gamble said, because the methane is away from the completed homes. When the Air Force vacated the old base in 1975, the area was divided among the Army, Navy and Military consultants and state water quality officials also concluded that the plume of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, beneath the subdivision would not endanger residents -- as long as they did not plant fruit trees, dig wells or expose themselves to polluted groundwater. The gasoline additive had leaked from underground storage tanks at a Navy gas station. In a Feb. 19 letter to home buyers, Shea Homes said it had "voluntarily delayed construction of our new homes in closer proximity to the landfill in order to determine what mitigation measures, if any, should be considered" to deal with the methane problem. Construction is expected to be delayed at least until the Gamble said that one new homeowner had demanded immediate air monitoring in her home but that others were taking the matter in stride. "I'm a little nervous about it, but I'm a holistic person -- I'm concerned about the air I breathe at the gas station," said Although the earlier tests showed methane levels to be safe, more tests performed last summer revealed significant concentrations of the gas near almost 30 lots at Hamilton Meadows. The Army's gas probes showed traces of methane seeping from the ground inside a buffer zone of 150 to 200 feet between the landfill and the home sites. More recent tests confirmed these results. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Jim+McAlister%22">Jim McAlister</a> "I personally don't believe there's a safety risk there," McAlister said. "I don't think there's an explosive hazard. A municipal landfill generates much more methane." Methane, an odorless and colorless gas, is commonly generated by decomposing dumps and also natural conditions such as bay mud and oil fields. The gas can cause an explosion if ignited in confined spaces. The old military dump contains construction debris, fuel residue, heavy metals, solvents, PCBs and pesticides. The Air Force stopped using the landfill in 1974 and capped it with clay and high-strength plastic in 1995. McAlister said the gas seemed to be escaping the landfill from a layer of soil between the bottom of the plastic cap and groundwater. The Army has hired a consultant to look at ways to fix the problem. Among the possibilities are digging a trench around the landfill and depositing gravel in it; planting trees to get oxygen into the soil; using an extractor to burn off the gas; and piping oxygen underground to help break down the methane. The Army's plan must be approved by the state Shea Homes' Gamble said the Army should install vents for the methane and a containment wall to prevent the gas from getting any closer to his home sites. "The Army has capped a landfill, and it's an improper capping," Gamble said. "They're the ones responsible. I think everyone is in agreement that there should have been a venting system." The question of whether the old military base had been cleaned up enough for homes to be built there fell to federal and state regulatory agencies. Marin County and Novato city planners were barred from deciding whether the land was a suitable place for people to live. But Novato played an active role in fostering the military's reuse plan for the airfield. The parcel for Hamilton Meadows was sold first by the Army to the city of Novato, which then sold it to a development partnership, which then sold it to Shea Homes about 18 months ago. Novato planners had envisioned a golf course and playing fields on top of the former landfill, but those plans have been put on hold. "There isn't anything that's going to happen there until we get the methane resolved," McAlister said.

 Caption Close San Francisco Bay is hundreds of times more contaminated than the Great Lakes with small plastic particles from cosmetics and synthetic clothing, a new study has found. And the small microbeads and other pollutants are gobbled up by fish, whose guts contain far more of the toxic stuff than their fellow Great Lakes fish. The study by senior scientist In January, Sutton took water samples from different spots in San Francisco Bay and analyzed the results. She found that the waters of the South Bay contained 2.6 million microplastic particles of 5 millimeters or smaller per square mile, compared with 285,000 in Lake Erie, 13,000 in Lake Superior and 7,800 in Lake Huron. In effect, that makes the South Bay 330 times more polluted than Lake Huron, Sutton said. “That was unexpected,” Sutton said. “I thought there would be a lower level in San Francisco Bay, because of its proximity to the ocean. We, as bay residents, are not taking such good care of the bay.” Her study, titled “Microplastic Contamination in San Francisco Bay,” also found that small fish  ingest the particles, mistaking them for food. “They’re gobbling these things up,” Sutton said. The plastic accumulates in the bodies of San Francisco Bay fish at a rate up to six times higher than Great Lakes fish. People who eat fish caught in the bay are also ingesting the plastics, Sutton said. Plastic particles can contain dangerous chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and other contaminants. Other sources of the pollution, besides cosmetics, are fishing lines, cigarette butts, synthetic clothing fibers and bits of plastic from packaging and utensils. Many cosmetic manufacturers have begun eliminating plastic microbeads from their products or replacing them with safer microbeads made from seashells or fruit pits, Sutton said. The state Senate has approved a bill, opposed by major cosmetics manufacturers, that would ban the sale of microbeads in cosmetics after 2020. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22Steve+Rubenstein%22">Steve Rubenstein</a>

 Caption Close Some of the hundreds of gallons of bunker fuel oil spilled Friday in San Francisco Bay have started washing onto shore, polluting area beaches and killing dozens of birds. State regulators suspended fishing and shellfish harvesting in parts of the bay, and officials asked people to avoid some beaches while mop-up efforts continue today. Meanwhile, "That's what the Coast Guard and Fish and Game are looking at right now ... the timeliness," said Lt. At 6:48 a.m. Friday, the Panamanian tanker The oil sheen quickly covered a miles-long swath of water; however, aerial assessments and measurements of the tanker's fuel capacity showed only 400 to 800 gallons of bunker fuel had been spilled, officials said Saturday. The cause of the spill is still under investigation, but early evidence pointed to mechanical failure. For watchdogs of the bay's ecosystem and wildlife, the incident brought back memories of the disastrous 2007 It took several hours Friday to deploy booms around the tanker. And at least one environmental group wondered why responders didn't immediately place a protective boom along Crown Memorial State Beach in Alameda - the spot hardest hit by the spill. By Saturday, tar balls - some the size of silver dollars and a few as big as seat cushions - had washed up along shore every 5 to 10 yards. About 60 oiled birds, about half that had died, were found at that site, according to the East Bay Regional Park District. The Coast Guard would confirm only the collection of 12 oiled-but-surviving birds. "It's a natural collection place for oil, and ( One dead grebe and an oil-soaked gull were found just across the Inner Harbor Channel at Middle Harbor, in Oakland, according to "We have the beaches closed to provide an onshore refuge for the birds," Escobar said. "Oiled birds need to get onshore because they lose their insulation." Self worried about the oil's impact on eelgrass beds around Alameda, which provide important spawning habitat for herring. The herring season - the bay's last commercial fishery - was canceled in September because of concerns about the health of the fish population. Self and others believe the Cosco Busan spill may have played a large role in killing off herring eggs. Nevertheless, some observers said it appeared that some of the region's response tactics - specifically communication among jurisdictions and agencies - had improved since 2007. The effort was also aided by clear weather and calm winds. For its part, the Coast Guard and coordinating agencies said they responded with "surgical" precision, limiting the oil impact to about 6 miles of shoreline. "I can assure we acted as quickly as possible as soon as we were notified," said By Saturday afternoon, the Coast Guard had deployed 22 vessels, one helicopter and teams of wildlife crews to assess damage along San Francisco and Alameda shorelines. All told, 53,000 feet of containment booms had been set out around the ship itself as well as important beaches. In addition to tar balls along Crown Memorial Beach, oil was washing up in the Ballena Isle Marina in Alameda, Coast Guard officials said. The California Department of Fish and Game banned shoreline fishing and shellfish harvesting until state health officials can evaluate any contamination caused by the spill. Closed areas include the Alameda County shoreline between the Bay Bridge and the San Mateo Bridge. Fishing should be avoided anywhere there is a visible sheen. San Francisco officials asked people to refrain from swimming in the bay and stay away from local beaches. But those warnings didn't keep everyone away. Shoshanna Tenn, 36, of Oakland, went to Crown Memorial Beach and offered to help, but she was turned away. "The bay is huge and we all use it, so it is important to keep it clean," Tenn said as she stared out at the booms laid out in the water protecting the bird sanctuary. "Our kids come to this beach. It's our home." <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex =solr&amp;query=%22Kay+Bloom%22">Kay Bloom</a> "I think somebody was careless and not doing their job right," Bloom, a volunteer doing plant restoration work at the sanctuary.

 Two days after the Vilaikam, a Laotian American, had not yet heard about the ship's accident. He'd been working long hours at a factory job, and when he set up his angling gear near the east end of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, it was nighttime - too dark to see any cleanup vessels that might have remained on the water. Only when Vilaikam returned home that Friday night, and he and a son had eaten some of the fish they had caught, did Vilaikam watch a TV newscast and realize the bay was polluted by oil that killed birds, shut down beaches and prompted state officials to consider a ban on bay fishing. Vilaikam, one of scores of subsistence fishers in the Bay Area, hasn't fished in the bay since. "I got fish - striper bass," said Vilaikam. "The fish was OK. We come and eat. After that, they said it was an oil spill. After that, we didn't go." Subsistence fishers - low-income anglers often from immigrant communities - rely on their catches to feed themselves and their family. On a single outing, Vilaikam can take in more than 30 fish - enough to last him, his wife and their three children for a week. In the wake of the oil spill, Vilaikam and other subsistence fishers have abandoned their usual places along the bay for rivers and waterways in the outer regions of the greater Bay Area. Vilaikam has gone as far as the Russian River to fish. Although subsistence anglers usually work out of the public view, state agencies are aware of them, and after the oil spill, the <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex= solr&amp;query=%22David+Lewis%22">David Lewis</a> "It's an issue that still doesn't get enough attention," Lewis said. "But given who the population is, I think they're always going to get less attention and services than people with money and people who vote." The number of subsistence fishers in the Bay Area is difficult to gauge, but their numbers aren't limited to immigrant communities, said For the Vilaikam, who has a fishing permit and legally moved to the United States in 1988, said fishing gives him unbridled joy. He often brings his wife and at least one of his children, and aside from greatly reducing his grocery bill, fishing lets him be in nature and provides a respite from his factory work. Since he arrived in the United States, Vilaikam has worked on and off in factories and warehouses that package electronics, candy sets and other goods. "Right now, I work six and seven days a week," said Vilaikam, standing in his backyard, where he grows vegetables. " Fishing is fun. When you go out, you're happy." In the weeks ahead, Vilaikam said he will return to his usual spot by the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. He has other favorite areas, including one by Marin County's Rodeo Beach, where he goes crabbing at night. Besides crab and catfish, Vilaikam likes mussels, which he finds under, and on, shoreline rocks around the bay. He and his family cook their fish on grills, slice it and mix it with lettuce for fish salad, and use it in other creative ways. Vilaikam said he and his son didn't get sick from eating the bay fish they caught two days after the oil spill. And he said neither he nor his family members have gotten ill from their heavy intake of fish, despite government warnings that an over-consumption of bay fish in general could be dangerous because they contain potentially high levels of toxic chemicals. Sometimes, Vilaikam said, he gets itchy skin from fishing, but he attributes that to irritants in the water he wades in with his fishing pole. He said his 11-year-old daughter gets itchy skin when she eats too much fish or crab. Vilaikam, who also shoots game birds for food, said he earns about $2,000 a month after taxes from his factory work. When he subtracts the money that goes for Medicare, rent, gasoline for his car, fishing equipment and other costs, he's left with little. Growing up in northern Laos, Vilaikam fished for fun with his father. Now, with his father and mother living with him in Richmond, Vilaikam fishes so they don't go hungry. The Cosco Busan oil spill has affected him, he said, but he and his family have learned to survive much bigger upheavals. "In Laos, it was war - we had to run out," he said. "It's good here. My family is happy."

 <strong>1999-02-28 04:00:00 PDT CALIFORNIA</strong> The state expects to adopt a policy by June that would allow burning instead of trying to mop up tar-like spills that kill seabirds and marine mammals and spoil the fragile coast. While some regulators caution that not enough is known about how air pollutants from petroleum fires affect sea life, most agree that burning could be preferable to letting hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil or fuel find its way to the coastline, according to an Examiner / For three years, the state The state wants to divide the coast into 10 zones, and set conditions for quick burn approvals with the goal of reacting within minutes of an accident. Burning must be done quickly, before the oil breaks up in the sea. Oregon officials say they averted a major environmental disaster at Coos Bay on Feb. 11 by setting fire to a wrecked Japanese freighter's 396,000 gallons of fuel oil. The 639-foot New Carissa had gone aground 300 yards from shore, cracking its hull and fuel tanks. Environmental officials had the choice of watching the fuel oil pollute Coos Bay, ruining crab habitat and killing seabirds, or setting it afire and causing air pollution. After hours of debate, they decided to approve the first burn to minimize a spill, calling the vast black clouds of pollution a necessary trade-off. A "Once you've got oil in the environment, you can't say no one will get hurt. The question is what will be hurt less," said Addassi stood on the Coos Bay beach Feb. 12 and monitored the second day of burning. "If you don't get the oil off the water, thousands and thousands of birds will die. It's unlikely that you'll get thousands and thousands of birds dying from particulates falling on the water," Addassi said. In Coos Bay, health officials allowed the burn when the wind was blowing away from the land. Officials found no violations of the air-quality standard for tiny particulates, the only measurement they took. Some studies of smoke plumes indicate the most significant human health risks come from particulates, which can trigger asthma and other respiratory illnesses and lodge deep in the lungs. Noxious gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen and sulfur dioxides and cancer-causing furans and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons dissipate before reaching the ground, they say. Yet Addassi has received comments from federal and California regulators recommending monitoring a whole range of pollutants released from oil burning, not just particulates. Some regulators, including those at the Since the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident, laws have required the industry to phase in oil tankers with double hulls and other safety measures. There are tougher controls on vessel traffic, requirements for on-site cleanup equipment and response plans plus higher fines on the polluters. Yet the possibility of major oil spills remains on the state's environmentally sensitive coastline, with rocky coves, tidal marshes, offshore islands with marine mammal breeding grounds, kelp forests, foraging seabirds and migrating seals, sea lions and whales. In California, about 4,000 vessels pass along the Central Coast every year. About 800 are oil tankers, many of which travel to San Francisco Bay. The rest are freighters and container ships that carry hundreds of thousands of gallons of their own fuel. Six major spills from tankers, freighters and pipelines dumped nearly 2.2 million gallons of oil off the Central California Coast in the last 15 years. "Since there is a high concentration of refineries and pipelines in the Carquinez Strait and adjacent to the Suisun Marsh, there is always the likelihood that this very sensitive environmental resource may be subject to spills," said If an accident happened here, officials might approve a burn outside the Golden Gate. But a burn in the Bay is unlikely, she said, citing concerns over harm to sensitive environmental sites, wildlife, wetlands and a highly populated area. U.S. policy allows burning from 35 to 200 miles off the coast of California if a response team recommends it. Federal jurisdiction extends from 200 miles to 3 miles offshore, where state territorial waters begin. Air quality districts have authority offshore under the federal Air quality regulators said they would consider approving burns 5 to 8 miles off the coast with winds blowing offshore or parallel to the shore, said "Everything else would be determined case by case, and that would depend on the meteorology. In the Bay, definitely not, under no circumstance," Libretti said. In past oil spills, cleanup crews generally have relied on skimming oil from water, still the preferred method. But skimming typically removes less than 20 percent of the spill. In some cases, crews use chemical dispersants, which either work well or don't work at all, depending on oil and weather conditions. According to the final draft of the state's burn plan, a conflagration of vast amounts of leaking cargo has advantages over skimming or dispersing oil. Burning can rapidly convert large quantities of oil into a black smoke plume. Carbon dioxide and water make up about 85 percent of the plume, and particulates in the form of soot about 14, says the The concentrations of all the pollutants decline downwind as clean air dilutes the smoke. Thus far, the most comprehensive review of burning on the West Coast is a document prepared two years ago by the Possible effects on wildlife in the ocean have not been extensively studied, federal officials say. Burn residues on the surface and below could be ingested by fish, birds and mammals and could foul the wildlife, the federal agencies said. Some federal and state regulators that commented on the state Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response's proposed policy took a skeptical look at issuing automatic permits to burn. National marine sanctuary managers have asked the state to require monitoring of water, air and ocean resources to determine all the pollutants that might be released during a burn. California Coastal Commission analysts Lilli Ferguson and Robin Blanchfield caution that before establishing a quick-approval policy for burning, the state might require an environmental review, which would carefully evaluate what kinds of effects combustion could have on the ocean and land. Coastal Commission staff will meet with oil spill officials to talk about what happened in Oregon. Burning destroyed about 190,000 gallons; about 70,000 gallons leaked to ocean waters.

 <strong>1997-10-02 04:00:00 PDT OAKLAND</strong> He kept working at the electroplating plant in East Oakland even after his father died, right up until the state shut it down this summer. At $8 an hour, chrome-plating computer parts "was a good job," Romero said yesterday -- and, he added, "I'd go back in a minute if I could." No chance of that. A huge hydrochloric acid spill at the plant Tuesday threatened to spew a lethal cloud of gas across East Oakland, forcing scores of residents to evacuate and nearly shutting down a BART line and nearby Interstate 880. As they finished mopping up the mess yesterday, state and federal officials said they would bill McSkimming for the cost of the plant cleanup -- estimated to be $400,000 so far -- and hinted they may charge him with violating toxics laws. If they do, it would be but the latest in a long string of fraud, workplace health and hazardous waste charges already facing the 60-year-old Reno man, his wife, The state Environmental Protection Agency padlocked K&L's two plating factories in East Oakland on September 19, capping off a legal battle that lasted more than a year. Investigators were still trying to sort out yesterday exactly how the spill occurred or whether the plant had been adequately checked in the days before the leak was discovered. An inspector who checked the plant Tuesday found a tub holding 1,500 gallons of hydrochloric acid cracked open, with most of the acid lapping at the sides of several vats containing a total of 3,000 gallons of cyanide. Had the two chemicals mixed, firefighters said, the result would have tossed up a lethal plume similar to the 1984 chemical cloud in Bhopal, India, that killed 2,300. More than 100 people were evacuated Tuesday, and all were allowed to return yesterday. Still to be cleaned up at the factory are another 40 vats, some of which contain acids and contaminated water. "We will use our authority to get him to pay for this," said McSkimming's attorney, "The state has assumed care, custody and control of the facility, and they allowed the release to happen," Jaffe said. "It is simply not true that the operator is responsible. "He's never had an incident like this at K&L, and then the state takes over and a couple of weeks later all hell breaks loose," Jaffe said. McSkimming could not be reached for comment. The state won a court order in July to shut down the K&L plant on Pearmain Street and another on 89th Avenue because of what state EPA toxics director The most tragic of those violations resulted in the death of Ramon Romero on Sept. 25, 1993, authorities say. Romero was trying to rescue a new employee who had crawled into a six-foot cyanide vat that day, and collapsed after shoving the other man out. He lay in a six-inch layer of toxic sludge while co- workers desperately tried to drag him free -- and by the time the rescue operation was over, two employees had passed out, 18 people, including emergency officials, were ill from fumes, and Romero was dead. McSkimming has argued in court that an autopsy was inconclusive about exactly what chemical killed him, and he termed the death an unfortunate accident. But the toxicologist who performed the procedure said that it made little difference and that the cause of death was "asphyxiation in a chemically toxic environment." McSkimming and his foreman, Francisco Romero, although acknowledging that his father's grisly demise was a blow to his Mexican immigrant family, maintained yesterday that working at K&L was a big step up from minimum-wage menial labor. "We don't speak much English, and Mr. McSkimming was good to us to give us this job," said Romero, who now drives a forklift in San Leandro. "A lot of us there felt like that." He was hired three years ago at K&L, joining his father, brother and cousin and about 80 other employees in putting metal plating on computer components, car bumpers and other industrial products. They worked with acids, cyanide and heavy metals, which meant the plant's huge vats and tanks needed swabbing out often. There was just one trouble, Romero recalled yesterday: the chemicals. "It was just dangerous when we had to change the chemicals, to mix them up," he said. "We didn't know much about it, and sometimes there were little accidents, little splashes. And it smelled bad." Alameda County prosecutors preparing to try McSkimming and Vasquez allege that the workers were poorly trained and equipped and that many were forced to climb into toxic tubs to clean them out by hand. Prosecutors wrote that "people who had been forced into these tanks illegally . . . had difficulty breathing. And they actually had to lift themselves out of the tank and gasp for air before going back down and doing more work." Workers said they earned between $6 and $12 an hour, and according to court documents, "most, if not all, of the operations workforce (consisted) of non-English-speaking Mexican aliens, both legal and illegal, many of whom are related to each other." McSkimming, who records said can speak no Spanish, built his plating business from a small shop in 1965 to a two-plant complex that grossed $3.7 million in 1995, up 57 percent over the previous year. Prosecutors allege in a 181-count money-laundering case, which has yet to be set for trial, that McSkimming, his wife and some of his co- workers underreported the payroll to avoid state insurance and tax payments. The company was also slapped with dozens of fines and state toxics citations between 1991 and 1997, totaling more than $750,000 for violations ranging from dumping hazardous waste into storm drains to poor safety training of workers. State officials said yesterday that they had considered cleaning up the plants an urgent task even before Tuesday's spill, and had given McSkimming two 20-day periods to do the job before taking over his operation. State officials decided to move when they became convinced that K&L "wasn't going to do all the right things in terms of proper disposal," said Adding to their concerns, he said, was information that McSkimming planned to move his operations to Tijuana. "Certainly this would be in direct conflict with the court order, which said they had to remove all chemicals and hazardous materials from the facility and cease operations," Dufour said. McSkimming's attorney would not comment on those allegations.

The Placer County resident died recently and tested positive for the virus, which is carried by rodents, health officials announced Wednesday. The resident likely contracted the virus from rodents in a home in the Lake Tahoe region, according to officials. It is not believed that there is an ongoing risk to the public from the sources of the deadly infection, health officials said. "This unfortunate loss reminds us that hantavirus is very dangerous," Placer County Health Officer Dr. Rob Oldham said. "But the silver lining is that hantavirus infections are quite rare and can be prevented. It appears that the source associated with this fatal infection has been cleaned.” Hantavirus can be carried by rodents through their urine, droppings and saliva. People can become infected when they breathe air contaminated with the virus. This mostly happens when someone stirs up rodent droppings or nesting material while cleaning a contaminated room, officials said. The virus is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of hantavirus typically show up two to four weeks after the exposure, but can appear as early as a week after or as late as eight weeks after. The beginning symptoms appear the like flu, and include fever, headache and abdominal, back and joint pain. The main symptom is difficulty breathing, which is caused by fluid building up in the lungs. < a href="http://www.placer.ca.gov/news/2018/may/hantavirus-warning" target="_blank">Click here for more information on hantavirus and ways to prevent against it</a> <em><a href="http://www.kcra.com/article/placer-county-resident-dies-after-contracting-hantavirus/20978883" target="_blank">This article originally appeared on KCRA. </a></em>

 Two Bay Area environmental advocacy groups are threatening Richmond with a lawsuit unless the city takes immediate steps to fix its ailing storm water and sewage system. San Francisco "From what we can tell, it's one of the highest spill rates in the state, " said The spills resulted from a range of problems, from flooding, which overwhelmed the system, to sewer line breaks and clogs. Choksi said the groups had reached their conclusions after poring over logs of customer service requests and responses, annual spill reports from the agencies running the systems and reports to water quality control boards and the state Richmond has 60 days to respond to the environmental groups' request to discuss possible solutions. At that point, the groups will decide whether to sue. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Bill+Lindsay%22">Bill Lindsay</a> "The bottom line is that to the extent our system needs to get better, we want it to get better," Lindsay said. Richmond's wastewater system has a history of problems, related to neglected maintenance. They include sewage backups into residents' basements, pipes broken by earthquakes, clogs caused by tree roots or grease, and spills in both wet and dry seasons. The fact that backups and spills happen even during dry weather is one indication of how serious the problems are, Choksi said. The largest single spill that the groups documented was in December 2003, when an estimated 18 million gallons of untreated wastewater overflowed at Harbor Way and Wright Avenue into the In 2002, the city contracted out the management and maintenance of its wastewater treatment plant, which handles 16 million gallons per day, to Houston-based He said that the city had hired Veolia in order to address its storm water system's problems and that the company had made operational and physical improvements to the plant in the past three years. Edwards, reached late Monday, had no statistics immediately available but said the company's success was the reason that its contract with the city had been expanded in 2004 to include maintenance of the city's storm-water pipes. Veolia is in the midst of preparing a master plan that will shape a systemwide upgrade, Edwards said. "The issues that have the greatest environmental impact will be fixed first," he added. Representatives of the West County Waste Water District, which also serves parts of Richmond, could not be reached for comment Monday.

 A state agency that focuses on protecting human health will oversee plans to build housing on a toxic site on the Richmond shoreline, officials said Tuesday, a move that followed a spirited legislative hearing. Critics had complained that environmental regulators were lax in their oversight of the site near Point Isabel Regional Park where a developer wants to erect a high-rise housing complex. A public hearing about the project, held Saturday, drew about 200 people, including many who questioned whether the public would be protected if contaminated dust was stirred up during cleanup of the property. In response, the state Environmental Protection Agency will put the state's "I'm just relieved and delighted that they are making this change and that they made it so quickly," said Hancock, D-Berkeley, who organized the hearing after fielding complaints that the water board had not done enough to protect the public.

The restoration of 22 acres of wetlands scarred by a century of toxic dumping had been scheduled to begin as early as today, when crews were to begin excavating 25,000 cubic yards of polluted soil from the marsh. But the state's Wolfe said the water board is eager to move forward. He said that because the endangered clapper rail lives nearby, work must take place in September and October so as not to disturb the nesting birds. If not, the work would be delayed until spring. "We're looking at how we can move this along as soon as possible," Wolfe said. "In general, we feel we're moving forward appropriately on the project." But not everyone agrees. On Tuesday, state Assemblywoman "There is a real danger in a sloppily performed toxic remediation," Hancock said.

 Caption Close Smoke and soot from the fire at Chevron's refinery in Richmond spread across a densely populated area, sickening thousands. But while the material found its way into lungs and bloodstreams, it did not find an air quality system that could measure it in a meaningful way. The network of air monitors run by the Bay Area The network is not - as it demonstrated Aug. 6 - geared for disasters like refinery fires. It couldn't provide much data in real time, and may never provide good numbers on the particulate fallout from the smoky blaze. Health officials believe those particulates were responsible for numerous emergency room visits by residents complaining of breathing problems. By the end of last week, the number of such visits totaled 11,000. "The coverage was just ridiculously bad compared to the thousands of lungs, noses and eyes experiencing effects of the toxic soup that was released," said The district maintains 40 monitors across the region, five of which are in western Contra Costa County. Some change may be coming. The fire - which started when a leak in a pipe ignited, sending a plume of smoke thousands of feet into the air - has fomented community pressure. <a href="/search/?action=search&amp;channel =bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22John+Gioia%22">John Gioia</a> "There needs to be additional monitoring," Gioia said. "We all have a right to know, as accurately as possible, what the air quality is after a release. We'll probably never know exactly, because you can't put a monitor on every block. But I think we can do better." Discussions are already under way at the air district, said spokeswoman "We're always looking at how we might improve our monitoring network, but this incident has made us refocus," Fasano said. "Is there technology out there that would allow us to provide better information? We're looking into that right now." Environmentalists said the fire offered a one-day window into a monitoring system that is inadequate every day. After the fire started, as residents were warned to shelter indoors, there was an effort to gauge what was in the air. Air district and county workers began using eight bowling ball-size portable canisters to take downwind air samples, looking for 23 toxic compounds, including benzene, which can cause cancer. The district said just one sample showed a contaminant exceeding state health guidelines - acrolein, which can cause skin, eye and respiratory tract irritation. However, the canisters do not test for particulate matter, which can irritate the eyes, nose and throat, and aggravate asthma and lung disease. In the long term, particulates can reduce lung function and prompt chronic bronchitis. Nor were particulates measured by Chevron employees who were dispatched to take samples after the fire. The only authoritative monitor of particulates in the area was in San Pablo, at an air district station 2 miles from Chevron. That filter-based monitor runs once every six days for 24 hours. Coincidentally, it ran the night of the fire, starting at midnight, 5 1/2 hours after ignition. The district said it needed two weeks to analyze the results, which haven't come back yet. The monitor, which looks a bit like R2-D2, the "Star Wars" robot, runs just once every six days because that offers a solid statistical sample, officials said. The Chronicle asked "The truth is, for this plant, and for many others, we really don't (know)," he said. "We need a better ongoing monitoring system ... in and around the industrial locations. If we're going to understand the impact of the pollution, we need to be more informed." Meaningful monitoring would require analysis of "dozens or hundreds of compounds," Jerrett said. Karras said environmentalists and residents have pushed for years for real-time monitoring of particulates downwind of Chevron. Karras said that would allow people - and their doctors - to make informed choices on what do after a release. Residents could also use the information to recoup damages from polluters, he said. "The company has resisted giving more resources to locals and to government agencies," Karras said, "and when they're criticized, they offer to do their own monitoring as an alternative. The trouble is, people don't trust the fox guarding the henhouse." In a statement, Chevron officials disagreed, saying that they work with more than 30 regulatory agencies under some of the nation's strictest pollution rules and have reduced pollution by 65 percent since the 1970s. They noted that vehicles and wood burning were far bigger sources of emissions. They also said that they were augmenting their own three ground-level monitors within the refinery - adding devices on the fence line and working with neighbors in North Richmond, Atchison Village and Point Richmond to find spots for monitors whose results would be posted online. "We are always reviewing efforts to improve air quality data and better inform the public," a company statement said. The Aug. 6 fire's emissions were difficult to analyze because the plume of smoke shot high into the air before spreading out and following the wind, according to the manager of the air district's laboratory, where samples are analyzed. "We've sometimes sent firefighters in there with their coats and masks to take a sample for us, and then you get a really strong sample," lab manager The eight canisters the district used after the Chevron fire had to be brought back to the San Francisco lab for analysis. Officials have looked into buying portable monitors that could spit out results in the field, but they don't think the technology is yet up to snuff, Hesson said. "You can do it - it won't be as good," Hesson said. "The portable instruments are getting better and better. ... But it will probably still be five to 10 years." One tool the district has considered is a 30-pound portable chromatographer that looks like a "Ghostbusters" backpack. It costs $130,000, is 50 times less precise than the canisters and doesn't measure particulates, Hesson said. "Do we want to spend that kind of money on something that doesn't work very well?" he asked. For particulates, regulators mulled using portable devices as well, which cost a few thousand dollars. But they found the Bay Area's famous fog would cause inaccurate readings. Dan Jacobson, legislative director for the nonprofit "This is sort of like drug testing on athletes - we're always behind the game," he said. "What we need is information constantly, and we need access to the information all the time. We shouldn't we be waiting for an accident and then trying to find out how bad it is."

When the stink settled, it left a fine mustard-brown dust on the Reed didn't think much of the near-constant smell back then. Nobody did. It was 1945, and it was just a fact of life that the Seaport war housing "We ignored it. We didn't think anything of it," said Reed, now 68. "We were kids." Urgently needing to house the boom of war workers flooding the Bay Area during World War II, authorities rushed to build thousands of new apartments in Richmond, especially near bayfront industrial sites. Seaport, opened in 1944, was the last to be built. A cluster of about 50 apartment buildings, it was wedged in a parcel of land bordered by the bay, a rail line and Stauffer's chemical plant. Whites and blacks both lived there, but in segregated housing. In 1956, Seaport was deemed a slum and torn down to make way for commercial development and Interstate 580. Production at the chemical plant continued, and through corporate mergers and restructuring, the property ultimately fell into the hands of Zeneca Corp. in the 1980s. Zeneca closed its operations there in 1997. Today, a developer wants to build high-rise homes on the 85-acre swath of land that Stauffer had polluted over the decades. Activists oppose the plan, concerned that toxic materials have not been properly cleaned up and fearful the site is too dangerous to ever be safe for homes. The controversy has stirred up former Seaport residents like Reed. They wonder what long-term health effects they may have suffered. "It's just a big question mark," said Reed, who has difficulty breathing because of growths in her lungs. A lung specialist told her it could be connected to her environment years ago, she said. Other former Seaport residents, like "It's like they were using us as the guinea pigs," said Dotson, 62, whose family moved to Seaport in 1944 and stayed for six years. "I was just a little girl." Dotson has been using public meetings and debate about use of the land to try to learn more about what she might have been exposed to. She has learned that arsenic, heavy metals, lead, nitric acid and volatile organic compounds were found there after Zeneca finally closed the plant in 1997. Dotson and Reed recall that the children of Seaport could see Stauffer's open-air ponds and sulfur beds through the chain-link fence. The boldest children disobeyed their parents, trespassing onto Stauffer's land to skim rocks in the yellow chemical ponds. Most also tramped through the nearby marsh, fishing or playing in the rocks by the bay, they recalled. That was where Stauffer openly dumped the iron pyrite cinders used in its production of sulfuric acid. The "mucky stuff" on the rocks along the bay is one of the few memories that "Living right there in that chemical plant had to have affected all of our health in some way or another," said Dillard. "But how are you going to prove that?" He acknowledges what Dotson and others have been disappointed to hear from health officials -- that it would be nearly impossible for an epidemiological study to give solid answers. They lived in Seaport for a short time and could have been exposed to other hazards since then. Still, for all their concerns, former residents have mostly fond memories of living in Seaport. The African American community there was close-knit and friendly, with families attending the same school, church and recreation center. Kids played baseball on the community diamond, and wives chatted as they hung laundry on the clotheslines that flapped in the backyards. Dotson has old photographs. In one, taken in 1948, the men who formed the "We all came from different areas, but in Richmond, we were one," Reed said. "Families looked out for each other's kids."

 <strong>2005-10-21 04:00:00 PDT Sacramento</strong > In separate actions after lengthy and heated public hearings, the state Clean-air advocates hailed the decisions, particularly the requirement, which starts in 2008, that truck drivers snoozing in sleeper cabs turn off their engines. A 2004 rule ordered truckers to shut down after idling for 5 minutes, but exempted sleeping truckers so they could run their heaters or air conditioners. Trucking industry representatives criticized the new requirement, saying it will leave many truckers shivering or sweating in their cabs instead of getting some much-needed rest. "Operators of trucks will be left with no feasible means of heating or cooling their trucks, and they need to be able to get good rest to stay alert," said Advocates of the shut-down-to-sleep regulation said it would protect residents -- most of them poor and nonwhite -- who live near ports and trucking hubs and suffer higher rates of asthma. And, they said, it would save 160 million gallons of fuel each year in the state. The air board's staff, which studied the sleeper cab issue for the past year, said that a number of devices using different technologies could be used to heat and cool cabs more cleanly and efficiently, and would pay for themselves with fuel savings in months in most cases, and two years at most. "It seems like a no-brainer to me," said Trucking industry representatives, however, said the devices were too costly and the technology hadn't been adequately tested. They said the new regulation's 2008 start date is too soon. Board members, who saw demonstrations of some of the devices that can be used to heat and cool sleepers, asked questions of some speakers but voted to ban overnight idling without debate. The new regulations would also require truck manufacturers to choose one of two options: install equipment that automatically shuts down idling engines after 5 minutes or install filters that meet especially stringent clean air requirements. "It's going to benefit the health of the economy and the state," said The decision to require transit agencies to gradually clean up their fleets of dirty old diesel buses was a compromise: For each new cleaner diesel vehicle a transit agency buys, it must install a pollution filter into an old diesel bus. The deal was worked out between environmentalists and transit agencies. In 2000, the air board voted to allow transit agencies to choose either to buy cleaner natural gas or other alternative fuel buses, or to stick with diesel but purchase reduced emission diesel buses and retrofit many of their older, more polluting buses and experiment with new technologies. Most Bay Area transit districts chose to stick with diesel. Both diesel and natural gas buses, however, must meet more stringent emission standards beginning with 2007 fleets, which transit agencies are ordering. Natural gas bus makers can meet those standards but diesel manufacturers say they can't, despite previous promises, though they expect to meet them by 2010. Faced with the likelihood that diesel districts would defer bus purchases and keep older dirtier buses on the road for three years rather than convert to natural gas, the board supported the compromise Thursday. It retains the emissions standards but allows the purchase of cleaner diesel buses that don't meet the regulations as long as the one-to-one retrofit is accomplished. Critics urged the board not to allow the compromise, hoping that adhering to the stricter standards would either force diesel manufacturers to meet them, or prompt transit agencies to buy natural-gas buses, boosting demand and jump-starting the market for cleaner buses. <a href="/search/?action= search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Steve+Heminger%22">Steve Heminger</a> "This was a debate about a very narrow question," he said. "There's no debate about cleaning up the air or cleaning up our diesel buses. The Bay Area has done well at that. The only question here was what do we do for a three-year period when cleaner diesel buses are not available."

 Caption Close An internal government memo obtained by The policy, expected to be confirmed in a Feb. 16 announcement, targets the decades-old dilemma of toxic water that drains from some west valley farms -- contamination that has caused the deformities and deaths of thousands of birds since the problem was first discovered at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in the 1980s. The new policy outlined in the memo involves: -- Paying potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in taxpayer money to farmers who would take about 194,000 acres of cropland out of production. -- Treating some farm drainage water with expensive technology to remove selenium, a naturally occurring element in west San Joaquin Valley soils that can poison wildlife and poses a danger to humans. -- Building more than 2,000 acres of artificial ponds in the valley to collect drainage water until it evaporates. Officials with the Some experts who have read the memo say the plan, which could cost upward of $2 billion, is much more expensive than past proposals and could amount to little more than payouts to a few hundred farmers. Many experts who monitor water issues in California say the memo represents an extreme departure from previous proposals. "The insanity of this plan defies economic, scientific and just plain common sense," said Stokely and other activists preferred earlier proposals that would have taken much more selenium-laden cropland out of production. Drain water from western San Joaquin Valley farms has been a problem for years. Growers there use salty irrigation water imported from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and delivered via a canal-and-pump system. The federal government subsidizes that water, delivering it to the farmers through long-term water contracts. Over time, salt builds up on the land and farmers flush it away with additional water. This takes away most of the concentrated salt, but it also flushes out large quantities of selenium that occur naturally in the soil. At sufficiently high levels, selenium can poison fish, wildlife and people. To solve the drainage disposal problem, the Bureau of Reclamation in 1968 started building the San Luis Drain so the contaminated water would flow into the delta. It was stopped in 1975 due to high costs and a growing awareness of selenium's dangers. In the 1980s, wildlife officials discovered that selenium-tainted drain water had caused birth deformities and deaths of thousands of birds at Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge, where some of the polluted water was sent. The San Luis Drain was never completed. So in 1995, the Westlands Water District -- which at 600,000 acres is the largest water district in the country and represents hundreds of farmers -- sued the federal government, demanding a solution to the dilemma of drain-water disposal. A federal appeals court in 2000 ordered the Bureau of Reclamation to solve the problem. Most recently, it seemed the Bureau of Reclamation was poised to pay farmers to permanently retire about 308,000 acres of farmland and build a large system of ponds to collect much of the remaining runoff water. That plan could have cost more than $300 million for the evaporation ponds and compensation to farmers for crop losses; perhaps another $900 million -- or $3,000 an acre -- would be paid to retire the land. Yet, according to the internal government memo, the agency now favors a much more expensive plan -- one that could cost between $2 billion and $3 billion over a 50-year-period. This new plan would retire only 194,000 acres of cropland, build even more evaporation ponds, and use reverse osmosis water-treatment technology to help remove the selenium from the drain water. Ultimately, any agreement that settles Westlands' lawsuit would have to be approved by a federal judge, and Congress would have to agree to pay for it. Bureau of Reclamation spokesman "We do have the legal right to select any alternative within the legal confines" of the environmental studies, said McCracken. "It is not unique to go from a preferred alternative to another alternative that meets everyone's interests." The affected farmers, in general, want to retire less land than environmentalists, who say the best solution to the selenium problem involves retiring as much land as possible. Stokely said the Bureau of Reclamation's new plan will only exacerbate the selenium problem. "The problem is easily solved. Less irrigation, less drain water," Stokely said. The Bureau of Reclamation's new plan may also allow irrigators to keep both the land and their promised allotments of federally subsidized water, Stokely said. The so-called "retired" land could then be irrigated with groundwater, he said. "Basically, the public will pay billions of dollars for worse than nothing. We'll have fewer options for solving the selenium problem and less control over public water," Stokely said. And tests by the "Anything else is a stalling action," he said. "Basically, the less water you put on the land, the less polluted water you have coming out the bottom." Skorupa also questioned the proposed ponds that would collect the selenium-tainted water and allow it to evaporate. The ponds are bird magnets, he said. "All things being equal, the fewer evaporation ponds, the better," he said. Westlands Water District spokeswoman "We're not confident any of the drainage options under consideration will really solve the problem," Woolf said. "Each of them has some problems." Woolf said she knew nothing about another aspect of the government memo: The proposed transfer of San Luis Reservoir, a water-storage reservoir owned jointly by the state and federal governments, to west valley water districts. The Los Banos-area reservoir now serves the farmers, Southern California municipalities and some Santa Clara County cities. Such a transfer would give farmers much more control over when -- and how much -- water is released. <a href="/search/?action =search&amp;channel=bayarea&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=solr&amp;query=%22Carl+Torgersen%22">Carl Torgersen</a> But "It's really inappropriate to be having discussions of disposing of a public resource to a private party," Schambach said. "Who's looking out for the public in this?" Regardless of how the Bureau of Reclamation proceeds, the scrutiny from the new Rep. "In the past, the Bureau of Reclamation and I have had many differences," Napolitano said. "We may be compelled to hold hearings on this current situation." Water coming off farms in the western San Joaquin Valley is picking up selenium, an element that can be poisonous to fish, wildlife and people. 1. Irrigation water is applied to croplands in the western San Joaquin Valley, an area with selenium-rich soils. 2. Salt in the irrigation water concentrates around the root zone of the plants. 3. To remove the concentrated salts and keep land productive, farmers flush their lands with more water. 4. The water that drains off the fields picks up selenium from the soil as well as salt. The high levels of selenium can be toxic to wildlife, especially birds.

 Caption Close The San Francisco Employees’ Retirement System’s governing board has taken tentative steps toward selling some of its $559 million stake in fossil fuel companies, agreeing to instruct its staff to begin assessing how the fund will define its “riskiest and dirtiest” investments. The pension plan’s staff will have until April 30 to come up with a plan to assess those investments. Once the board is satisfied with that plan,  the staff is instructed to plan on how to sell off those assets, reporting back in the late summer or early fall. “I want benchmarks and clarity,” said Malia Cohen, a city supervisor who also serves on the SFERS board, after it met on Wednesday. Citing the environmental risks posed by the fossil fuel industry, political and environmental activists have called on the SFERS board to pull out of its investments in oil, natural gas and coal companies and embrace emerging renewable energy technologies. The SFERS staff has long advised the board against doing so, however, citing the potential financial damage to the fund. The board’s moves proved deeply frustrating for many in attendance Wednesday, who had sought more significant steps toward divestment. “It just feels so vague and noncommittal,” said Jack Fleck, a retiree who worked for the city for 25 years. Victor Makras, a SFERS board member and strong divestment proponent, said he remained optimistic that the board would “vote on the first round of stocks to divest” by August. The board also agreed to shift $1 billion in investments away from high-emission polluters and to hire a new staff member to help ensure that the pension fund is engaging in “socially responsible investing.” Dominic Fracassa is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
